                    beauty brand's website, Bling Girl.

         <section>
            <p>
                In this essay, I will critically analyse the UI and UX of Bling Girl’s website, as a user who is not only 
                a customer but an aspiring nail technician. Bling Girl is a South African beauty brand that was established 
                in 2010. They sell affordable, high quality beauty products, with a focus on nail artistry products. Their 
                digital platform, Bling Girl Online, acts as a central hub for customers to browse products and purchase 
                items nationwide.
            </p>

            <p>
                I will focus on how the website functions across multiple devices (mobile, PC and tablet) and examine the 
                ethical implications of the website’s design decisions. Bling Girl’s website present a visually engaging 
                interface, it suffers from issues relating to navigation, consistency and accessibility. These challenges are 
                important in the context of an online shopping platform that aims to serve a diverse customer base.
            </p>

            <p>
                To support my analysis, I will use Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton’s Web Style Guide (2009), The Upwork Team’s 
                Brand Style Guides (2024), Adam Scott’s Building Web Apps for Everyone (2016) and Team DesignLab’s Ethical 
                Considerations in UX Design (2024). I will examine how the site aligns or even fails to align with established 
                UI/UX principles, then briefly reflect on how it compares to more intuitive alternatives like Nails By Nicole. 
                The focus of this essay is inspired by the brief analysis I did on Bling Girl’s website in Week 7’s blog post.
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                When landing on the homepage, Bling Girl’s website immediately positions itself as a vibrant, trendy beauty brand 
                that is up to date with nail market trends that appeal to beauty enthusiasts, aspiring nail techs and experienced 
                professionals. However, despite its visually bold appearance, the user experience (UX) across different devices is 
                inconsistent, and at times frustrating.
            </p>

            <p>
                On desktop, the homepage features large promotional banners for the items on special, call to action links, and
                what appears to be featured items, though the items are not explicitly labelled as such, testimonials are at the 
                bottom of the page. While there are basic features like a search bar and a fixed navigation bar that minimizes 
                when you scroll down, there is a lack of product filtering and product navigation on the homepage. The layout feels 
                chaotic and scrolling feels infinite without clear structure since items are just scattered randomly. As Lynch and 
                Horton (2009) explain, “Users are not impressed with complexity that seems gratuitous, especially those users who 
                may be depending on the site for timely and accurate information”. This is true, especially on Bling Girl’s homepage, 
                where the ‘back to top’ button is hidden by a WhatsApp popup. So if the users do not even notice that it is there, 
                then they would rely on scrolling, making the whole experience frustrating, especially for users who expect a quick 
                browse and click experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                On mobile, the experience declines further. The product images have not been scaled well to efficiently use the 
                dimensions of a mobile device. Where they could have scaled down text and images to include two or three products 
                in a row, everything appears oversized, leading to unnecessary scrolling. The fixed nav bar is at the bottom of the 
                screen but is hard to see since there is a ‘Ask In WhatsApp’ popup, covering nearly 50% of the nav bar. These two 
                issues indicate that users must constantly scroll up and down and reposition just to access basic navigation.
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../essay-images/essay-1-images/bling-girl-homepage-mobile-screenshot.jpg"

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Again, product filtering is absent, and the product categories lack clarity. While on the homepage, the wayfinding 
                    is not much of a problem on both devices due to the nav bar, however as I discussed in my blog post, the navigation 
                    past the homepage is very frustrating. There are a lot of unnecessary, repetitive categories, with some leading to 
                    empty product pages. As a nail artist with experience, the way items are categorised lacks logic and would confuse 
                    new users who are looking for specific items. This reflects poorly on the site’s ‘findability” and “discoverability”, 
                    two concepts that Lynch & Horton (2009) discuss in their article. Findability refers to a user’s ability to find 
                    expected content easily, while discoverability refers to the user being exposed to new, useful content. Bling Girl’s 
                    homepage offers some level of discoverability but falls short in terms of findability and organisation especially on 
                    mobile, where the display is much smaller, and clarity is crucial.
                </p>

                </div>

            <p>
                Tablet responsiveness falls somewhere in-between but still reflect the same design inconsistencies. As a user who would 
                like to run a professional nail business, these simple issues are not just inconvenient but discouraging. When trying 
                to access the website’s hamburger menu on a tablet whenever I scrolled down then the whole menu would just disappear 
                but show that it is still ‘active’. The navigation inconsistencies imply a lack of consideration for mobile-first 
                design and for the user’s navigation experience, which also implies a disconnect from the actual needs of the brand’s 
                target users. This is a problem because we are in a time where many users access websites and shop mainly from their 
                phones or tablets, and these oversights can negatively impact customer retention.
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                Bling Girl may aim to impress with their bold visuals, but the website’s user interface (UI) showcases a chaotic 
                aesthetic that fails to define a cohesive brand identity. The elements feel disjointed, making it hard to grasp what 
                the brand actually represents. From the colour palette and the layout, there is a lack of visual harmony and strategic 
                design that guides users, leaves them feeling confused rather than captivated.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most noticeable issues is the lack of a consistent colour scheme. The homepage jumps between pastel pinks 
                and purples, neon pinks, black and white and depending on the season, even glitter backgrounds without any clear 
                reason. Instead of using the homepage to reinforce the brand’s visual appeal, the use of colour feels discombobulated 
                and overstimulating. The addition of flashing product GIFs only adds to the visual pollution. If the site’s logo was 
                not placed at the top of the homepage, nothing else about the layout would suggest that I was currently on Bling 
                Girl’s website. There is a visual identity crisis, and strangely it’s only on the homepage. The rest of the website 
                (related to product browsing) maintains a similar layout, sticking to a basic black and white colour palette. It is 
                very confusing why the cleaner design was not maintained on their homepage?
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some positives, such as the high-quality visual imagery on the website. Product photos are crisp in all 
                sections, allowing users to see the items in detail. However, there is a lack of visual rhythm. There is no consistent 
                lighting, posing or even background tones to make the product showcases feel polished and professional. On the homepage 
                some products have a black background, others have multi-coloured borders, some have plain white background while 
                others are very zoomed in to the point where we cannot see the background. The product navigation pages does it a bit 
                better by advertising similar products in similar ways. One helpful feature to note is that when browsing through 
                the product navigation pages there is a ‘quick view’ button which allows the user to get information on the product 
                without leaving the page they are on. Still, the layout of products on the homepage and product pages display items 
                in long, disorganised columns and rows. The filtering system on the product navigation pages also feels messy and 
                unintuitive, which does not align with the luxury beauty experience they aim to create.
            </p>

            <p>
                Luckily, not everything is a disaster. In terms of accessibility, the website does succeed through its use of black 
                text on white backgrounds, except for the homepage. There is a section with darkened grey text on a black background, 
                even the light grey text within the purple footer. (The homepage is a mess.) Despite this, the places where a high 
                contrast is maintained improves readability, especially for users with visual impairments. Still the contrast alone 
                does not save the rest of the visual structure. The entire website feels like a mood board that they forgot to refine 
                and tailor to their website, then just left all their ideas on the homepage.

                    <p> 
                        Upwork’s Brand Style Guide (2024) emphasises how crucial consistent branding is for user trust and recognition. 
                        They state, “Consumers can feel strong bonds with their favorite brands. They become familiar with the brand’s 
                        values and unique traits.” And “consumers tend to buy from brands that reflect their personal values.” In 
                        Bling Girl’s case, the lack of visual consistency ruins the memorability. Without strong branding, the website 
                        does not communicate professionalism or reliability, which are essential characteristics within the beauty 
                        industry. Without a cohesive visual identity, Bling Girl’s UI fails to resonate with users who value clarity, 
                        consistency and style in their digital shopping experience.
