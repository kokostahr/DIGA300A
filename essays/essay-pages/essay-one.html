                    In this essay, Star explores the user interface and experience of Bling Girl, a South African beauty 
                    brand’s site, through a design-focused lens on user-experience, user interface and accessibility of the website
                    in a country where data and access to digital technology is a privilege.

            <p>
                In this essay, I will critically analyse the UI and UX of Bling Girl’s website, as a user who is not only 
                a customer but an aspiring nail technician. Bling Girl is a South African beauty brand that was established 
                in 2010. They sell affordable, high quality beauty products, with a focus on nail artistry products. Their 
                digital platform, Bling Girl Online, acts as a central hub for customers to browse products and purchase 
                items nationwide.
            </p>

            <p>
                I will focus on how the website functions across multiple devices (mobile, PC and tablet) and examine the 
                ethical implications of the website’s design decisions. Bling Girl’s website present a visually engaging 
                interface, it suffers from issues relating to navigation, consistency and accessibility. These challenges are 
                important in the context of an online shopping platform that aims to serve a diverse customer base.
            </p>

            <p>
                To support my analysis, I will use Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton’s Web Style Guide (2009), The Upwork Team’s 
                Brand Style Guides (2024), Adam Scott’s Building Web Apps for Everyone (2016) and Team DesignLab’s Ethical 
                Considerations in UX Design (2024). I will examine how the site aligns or even fails to align with established 
                UI/UX principles, then briefly reflect on how it compares to more intuitive alternatives like Nails By Nicole. 
                The focus of this essay is inspired by the brief analysis I did on Bling Girl’s website in Week 7’s blog post.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                When landing on the homepage, Bling Girl’s website immediately positions itself as a vibrant, trendy beauty brand 
                that is up to date with nail market trends that appeal to beauty enthusiasts, aspiring nail techs and experienced 
                professionals. However, despite its visually bold appearance, the user experience (UX) across different devices is 
                inconsistent, and at times frustrating.
            </p>

            <p>
                On desktop, the homepage features large promotional banners for the items on special, call to action links, and
                what appears to be featured items, though the items are not explicitly labelled as such, testimonials are at the 
                bottom of the page. While there are basic features like a search bar and a fixed navigation bar that minimizes 
                when you scroll down, there is a lack of product filtering and product navigation on the homepage. The layout feels 
                chaotic and scrolling feels infinite without clear structure since items are just scattered randomly. As Lynch and 
                Horton (2009) explain, “Users are not impressed with complexity that seems gratuitous, especially those users who 
                may be depending on the site for timely and accurate information”. This is true, especially on Bling Girl’s homepage, 
                where the ‘back to top’ button is hidden by a WhatsApp popup. So if the users do not even notice that it is there, 
                then they would rely on scrolling, making the whole experience frustrating, especially for users who expect a quick 
                browse and click experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                On mobile, the experience declines further. The product images have not been scaled well to efficiently use the 
                dimensions of a mobile device. Where they could have scaled down text and images to include two or three products 
                in a row, everything appears oversized, leading to unnecessary scrolling. The fixed nav bar is at the bottom of the 
                screen but is hard to see since there is a ‘Ask In WhatsApp’ popup, covering nearly 50% of the nav bar. These two 
                issues indicate that users must constantly scroll up and down and reposition just to access basic navigation.
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../essay-images/essay-1-images/bling-girl-homepage-mobile-screenshot.jpg"

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Again, product filtering is absent, and the product categories lack clarity. While on the homepage, the wayfinding 
                    is not much of a problem on both devices due to the nav bar, however as I discussed in my blog post, the navigation 
                    past the homepage is very frustrating. There are a lot of unnecessary, repetitive categories, with some leading to 
                    empty product pages. As a nail artist with experience, the way items are categorised lacks logic and would confuse 
                    new users who are looking for specific items. This reflects poorly on the site’s ‘findability” and “discoverability”, 
                    two concepts that Lynch & Horton (2009) discuss in their article. Findability refers to a user’s ability to find 
                    expected content easily, while discoverability refers to the user being exposed to new, useful content. Bling Girl’s 
                    homepage offers some level of discoverability but falls short in terms of findability and organisation especially on 
                    mobile, where the display is much smaller, and clarity is crucial.
                </p>

                </div>

            <p>
                Tablet responsiveness falls somewhere in-between but still reflect the same design inconsistencies. As a user who would 
                like to run a professional nail business, these simple issues are not just inconvenient but discouraging. When trying 
                to access the website’s hamburger menu on a tablet whenever I scrolled down then the whole menu would just disappear 
                but show that it is still ‘active’. The navigation inconsistencies imply a lack of consideration for mobile-first 
                design and for the user’s navigation experience, which also implies a disconnect from the actual needs of the brand’s 
                target users. This is a problem because we are in a time where many users access websites and shop mainly from their 
                phones or tablets, and these oversights can negatively impact customer retention.
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                Bling Girl may aim to impress with their bold visuals, but the website’s user interface (UI) showcases a chaotic 
                aesthetic that fails to define a cohesive brand identity. The elements feel disjointed, making it hard to grasp what 
                the brand actually represents. From the colour palette and the layout, there is a lack of visual harmony and strategic 
                design that guides users, leaves them feeling confused rather than captivated.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most noticeable issues is the lack of a consistent colour scheme. The homepage jumps between pastel pinks 
                and purples, neon pinks, black and white and depending on the season, even glitter backgrounds without any clear 
                reason. Instead of using the homepage to reinforce the brand’s visual appeal, the use of colour feels discombobulated 
                and overstimulating. The addition of flashing product GIFs only adds to the visual pollution. If the site’s logo was 
                not placed at the top of the homepage, nothing else about the layout would suggest that I was currently on Bling 
                Girl’s website. There is a visual identity crisis, and strangely it’s only on the homepage. The rest of the website 
                (related to product browsing) maintains a similar layout, sticking to a basic black and white colour palette. It is 
                very confusing why the cleaner design was not maintained on their homepage?
            </p>

            <p>
                There are some positives, such as the high-quality visual imagery on the website. Product photos are crisp in all 
                sections, allowing users to see the items in detail. However, there is a lack of visual rhythm. There is no consistent 
                lighting, posing or even background tones to make the product showcases feel polished and professional. On the homepage 
                some products have a black background, others have multi-coloured borders, some have plain white background while 
                others are very zoomed in to the point where we cannot see the background. The product navigation pages does it a bit 
                better by advertising similar products in similar ways. One helpful feature to note is that when browsing through 
                the product navigation pages there is a ‘quick view’ button which allows the user to get information on the product 
                without leaving the page they are on. Still, the layout of products on the homepage and product pages display items 
                in long, disorganised columns and rows. The filtering system on the product navigation pages also feels messy and 
                unintuitive, which does not align with the luxury beauty experience they aim to create.
            </p>

            <p>
                Luckily, not everything is a disaster. In terms of accessibility, the website does succeed through its use of black 
                text on white backgrounds, except for the homepage. There is a section with darkened grey text on a black background, 
                even the light grey text within the purple footer. (The homepage is a mess.) Despite this, the places where a high 
                contrast is maintained improves readability, especially for users with visual impairments. Still the contrast alone 
                does not save the rest of the visual structure. The entire website feels like a mood board that they forgot to refine 
                and tailor to their website, then just left all their ideas on the homepage.
            </p>

                    <p> 
                        Upwork’s Brand Style Guide (2024) emphasises how crucial consistent branding is for user trust and recognition. 
                        They state, “Consumers can feel strong bonds with their favorite brands. They become familiar with the brand’s 
                        values and unique traits.” And “consumers tend to buy from brands that reflect their personal values.” In 
                        Bling Girl’s case, the lack of visual consistency ruins the memorability. Without strong branding, the website 
                        does not communicate professionalism or reliability, which are essential characteristics within the beauty 
                        industry. Without a cohesive visual identity, Bling Girl’s UI fails to resonate with users who value clarity, 
                        consistency and style in their digital shopping experience.
                    </p>
                </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                The desktop experience already lacks cohesion, which as mentioned earlier, only worsens the mobile and tablet 
                experience. The WhatsApp popup may not seem like a big deal at first glance, but its persistent flashing presence 
                at the bottom of the screen becomes visually distracting, especially when it hovers over key functions like the 
                mobile navigation bar and the ‘back to top’ button on the desktop version. This is a UI oversight that interferes with 
                navigation and creates friction in the user journey. On smaller screens, space is scarce and should be treated with 
                consideration, to ensure they do not derail the user’s ability to interact with the website.
            </p>

            <p>
                What may further complicate the mobile experience is the website’s data-heavy nature. Gifs that autoplay and 
                high-resolution images may not be optimised for mobile use, leading to lag and extended loading times. This is an 
                accessibility barrier for users with limited data or unstable internet connections. The homepage may seem like a 
                fun product showcase but fails to consider the mobile-first design, due to these issues and exclude a significant 
                portion of the user base, especially in a country where internet stability is an on-going issue for most.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inclusivity should be a core pillar of UX design, especially in a beauty-based eCommerce space where customers vary 
                in age, technology literacy and shopping preferences. When you open Bling Girl’s about, they specifically state that 
                they “ launched a convenient nationwide online shopping experience” but these navigation related issues on their 
                website, only contradicts the so-called convenience. As someone who is experienced in nail artistry, I personally 
                know what to look for but still feel overwhelmed by the lack of structure. Again, I question how a beginner would 
                feel. Bling Girl’s website would probably leave them feeling discouraged from exploring further.
            </p>

            <p>
                A truly inclusive website would take beginners, experienced artists, colour blind users, users with limited internet 
                access and older shoppers into account, providing them all with a calmer and simplified experience. Scott (2016) 
                discusses the importance of web developers responsibly shaping users’ online experiences by making ethical, 
                user-centred choices. Two key principles stand out: “web applications should work for everyone,” and “web applications 
                should work everywhere.” These values are echoed by DesignLab (2024) who state “An ethically sound UX design ensures 
                that digital products are usable by people with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and skill sets. By designing 
                with accessibility in the forefront, you also open up your product to a larger potential audience.” Accessibility is 
                an important factor that Bling Girl’s website does not fully take into consideration.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mobile version of the site seems to prioritise aesthetics over thoughtful, ethical UX design. A more refined 
                approach would acknowledge user needs, to reduce the visual clutter, ensuring important features are not blocked and 
                by optimising the layout for mobile use.

                    <p> 
                        In contrast to Bling Girl’s chaotic website, NailsByNicole, another beauty eCommerce website that focuses 
                        on nail artistry, is far more intuitive and offers a user-centred design. The homepage is clean, minimalistic 
                        and free from distractions. This instantly feels like a more welcoming and reliable first impression, 
                        especially for new users. Navigation is straightforward with all categories clearly listed in the navigation 
                        bar, with sub-category drop-down menus. The website maintains a consistent colour scheme: pink, black, white 
                        and grey. Unfortunately, the pink and grey colours used clash with the white background, causing some contrast 
                        issues. Unlike Bling Girl’s visually overwhelming homepage, Nails By Nicole uses white space and visual 
                        hierarchy to easily guide users through the website. There are no distracting popups or Gifs that may cause 
                        lag or issues related to internet connectivity. The homepage has a call to action, that encourages users to 
                        explore their newest products, and a ‘back to top’ button available on all devices. The responsive scaling on 
                        the mobile version is not overwhelming and maintains the clean aesthetic on the desktop version.

                        Despite a few contrast issues, the developers of the website have managed to create a seamless shopping 
                        experience that prioritises function over flash. This comparison highlights how even smaller-scale beauty 
                        related websites, can still offer thoughtful, accessible UX design without sacrificing the brand’s aesthetic 
                        appeal or website’s usability.

                    <p> 
                        In summary, Bling Girl’s website clearly struggles with basic UX principles like simple, intuitive navigation, 
                        visual hierarchy (on the homepage) and accessibility. While its aesthetic may appeal at first glance, the 
                        website prioritises form over function, creating a frustrating experience for users. Compared to competitors 
                        like Nails By Nicole, that offers a distraction-free experience with thoughtful layout choices, Bling Girl 
                        feels cluttered and unrefined. Other beauty websites like Born Pretty present smoother mobile functionality 
                        and clearer category divisions, showing that user-friendly does not mean a brand has to sacrifice visual appeal.

            <p>
                In a digital space meant to serve diverse users, usability and accessibility should be a priority. Inclusive design 
                empowers all users. As designers and developers we have a responsibility to craft experiences that are welcoming and 
                responsive. Visual appeal should never come at the expense of basic functionality.
