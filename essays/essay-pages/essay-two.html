                    In this essay Star critically analyses Google Maps’ 2025 renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, revealing how digital 
                    infrastructures and platforms enable modern colonial power through algorithmic control. It examines digital 
                    inequality, decolonial theory, and the geopolitical consequences of online representation in a world dominated 
                    by Big Tech. 
                </p>
        </div>

         <section>
            <p>
                On the 20th of January 2025, US President Donald Trump signed a fresh executive order, on his first day in office, 
                officially renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Within days, Google Maps complied and updated the 
                display for US users. It was truly a bizarre moment; an act of digital rebranding hidden behind a ‘policy’, 
                where a map was changed in an instant. This triggered massive backlash from Mexico, Cuba, Latin America leaders and other 
                international bodies
            </p>

            <p>
                But beyond this absurd display of nationalism, this seemingly minor digital renaming exposes a scarier crisis: Who gets to 
                name, claim and shape our realities in the age of the internet? Who actually controls the digital sphere? When 
                geography-based platforms, especially those run by tech giants like Google, have become the default way billions of 
                people understand the world, then altering a name is not just about “updates” and semantics. It is about power and 
                control and seemingly exercises a modern form of territorial dominance.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this essay, I argue that the Gulf renaming incident illustrates how digital infrastructure can and still continues to 
                reproduce geopolitical hierarchies through subtle yet violent acts of representation. I will explore through the lens of 
                digital coloniality, drawing from Toussaint Nothias’s (2025) An Intellectual History of Digital Colonialism, Keith Dear’s 
                (2022) Beyond the Geo in Geopolitics, Greenstein et al.’s (2018) How Geography Shapes-and Is Shaped by-the Internet, 
                Robinson et al.’s (2015) Digital Inequalities and Why They Matter, and Veracini & Weaver-Hightower’s (2024) New Media: 
                Decolonial Opportunities or Digital Colonialism?
            </p>

            <p>
                To ground this analysis, I will also reference reactions from news outlets. This will help show that what took 
                place was not just a random ‘political’ decision, and instead how systemic it was. It reveals how easy it is for 
                world powers to rebrand through the interfaces that we tap into daily.

                </figure>

                <p>
                    As I stated earlier, after US president Trump signed the executive order that officially renamed the Gulf, 
                    Google Maps responded immediately, ensuring that its US platform only reflected the name change. Sky News 
                    reported “For users of Google in the US, , if they now scroll over the Gulf, they will find it renamed the 
                    Gulf of America. Users elsewhere, for example in the UK, are met with the Gulf carrying both names: 
                    "Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)".” (Sky News, 2025).
                </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                This change sent reasonable shockwaves internationally. The Mexican government condemned it with Mexican President, 
                Claudia Sheinbaum stating that the change “cannot apply” (Sky News, 2025). 
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">

                <p>
                    People were not just mad because of the name change, but about what the name represented.  A powerful nation 
                    had the audacity to digitally overwrite geography, history and culture to seemingly serve its own nationalist 
                    agenda. The Gulf of Mexico is historically tied to Mexico, Cuba and various Latin American nations. Freking, 
                    from AP News states that the Gulf had carried its name for more than 400 years before the change took place (Freking, 2025). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    By renaming the Gulf, the US used digital tools to reassert dominance over a space that is not theirs. This 
                    change benefits only the US, or rather the interesting flavour of American nationalism President Trump pushes. 
                    It fuels a vision of American supremacy where even digital maps can be used as propaganda. The reason for the 
                    executive order was because “…this legislation recognizes the strategic influence America has over this 
                    geography, not to mention the existing economic, cultural, and commercial might that we passively exert on the 
                    Gulf,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C.” (Freking, 2025) purposely ignores the heritage and history the name and 
                    of the millions of people living along the coast of the Gulf
                </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                This was truly a digital slap in the face for Mexico and other Latin American countries, since their history and 
                visibility was diminished by algorithmic erasure, in one of the most-used geographical databases in the world. 
                This was a soft act of colonialism, echoing centuries of territorial theft, disguised in the UX of Google Maps. 
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                We witnessed a digital landgrab, from a modern tech empire that dominates our daily lives. As Toussaint Nothias (2025) 
                puts it, digital colonialism is marked by a “profound unequal concentration of power,” which is true for US based 
                tech companies like Google, since they design and control digital infrastructure in ways that mimic historical colonialism. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When Google Maps, a platform used by billions, decides to rename a region without consulting the countries most 
                connected to it, then it undermines the importance of those countries and hides algorithmic imperialism 
                behind ‘harmless UI design’.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nothias also draws attention to how tech monopolies operate under a cloak of ‘benevolence’. They frame their moves 
                as “neutral”, “user-responsive” or “data-driven”; but no matter how much they try to sugarcoat it, changing the 
                name of a region with centuries of Indigenous Latin and African martime history, is cultural erasure. May I 
                again bring attention to the fact that the countries were not consulted before this took place?
            </p>

            <p>
                Veracini and Weaver-Hightower (2024) note: “Gone seem to be the days of a global ‘sharing’ economy…’Community’ online 
                has proved elusive or a weasel word never actually intended by corporate agents.” The internet and digital technologies
                were once full of promise for collaboration and decolonial expression but continuously fail to encourage and make space 
                for these promises in our current world. Data was used as resource extraction. A cultural space was mined and changed, 
                only to reinforce US dominance, not just physically, but digitally too. I’d argue that this feels like a power play that 
                those in the Global South (in this case Mexico and neighbouring nations) are being told to accept. Colonialism never 
                truly disappeared.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                Despite being sold the idea that the internet is “borderless”, it’s quite clear that geography plays a big role within 
                the digital space. As Greenstein et al (2018) argue, “the costs and gross benefits of technology adoption may vary 
                significantly across geographical locations”, meaning that even if we all technically use the same internet, not all of 
                us get to shape it.
            </p>

            <p>
                The US has the infrastructure, corporate dominance and the capital to simply rename oceans on platforms like Google Maps. At 
                the same time, countries that are right next to the Gulf, were given zero input. This change was probably sprung on them by 
                surprise, like the rest of the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is exactly what Robison et al. (2015) meant when they said: “Digital inequality and exclusion cannot be analysed 
                apart from the offline circumstances of individuals and groups.” The same countries and communities who have historically 
                been marginalized offline, are getting the exact same treatment online. The only thing that changed is the interface.
            </p>

            <p>
               This feels like it is more about control than access. Who gets a fair opportunity to represent themselves digitally? And 
               who has the bandwidth to change and erase history? If Google, backed by a nationalist political agenda, can casually 
               redraw international boundaries for US users, then it begins to look more like the beginnings of a digital empire building itself. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Greenstein et al. remind us that the internet does not actually make everything ‘fair’. The benefits of digital technologies 
                still favour those who live in urban, developed areas with access to digital technologies that make internet accessibility 
                easier (e.g. wifi, fibre, laptops), which mostly consists of those living in the Global North. 
            </p>

                Seeing these changes makes me wonder if real disputes and wars in the future would be fought with algorithms and digital 
                mapping. It sounds a bit absurd, but we are already witnessing the first steps towards it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                According to Keith Dear (2022), we have officially entered the era of “new mercantilism.” Dear writes: “Automation, 
                robotics and AI reduce state’ dependence on people to create wealth but increase their dependence on overseas markets.” 
                This means that countries do not necessarily need as many workers anymore, but instead need data, influence and control 
                over digital spaces to stay powerful. And what better tool for domination for something as subtle and persuasive as Google Maps?
            </p>

            <p>
                When President Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”, it felt like he and his Republicans were testing 
                the waters to see what future territorial control might look like, not just physically but also through code on a cloud 
                software. New empires are now making their mark on regions by silently planting digital data flags. It is hard to fight 
                back against a change that we did not even know was about to occur, and I fear for the upcoming days where we will see 
                tech giants backed by political schemes try to take advantage of, and control of previously marginalised countries. Are we next?
            </p>

            <p>
                As Dear warns, we are heading towards a world where the metaverse also becomes a battlefield; states will compete for 
                users, markets and digital sovereign. The renaming of the Gulf, is the blueprint for algorithmic colonisation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>
                What we have witnessed with the sudden rebranding of the Gulf of Mexico is more than a political stunt. Behind every 
                interface we use, is a powerhouse that silently decides who truly owns the digital space. If Google Maps can shift 
                borders by updating code, well it truly makes me wonder what all Google applications and services are capable of and have 
                been doing behind the scenes. Companies just as big as Google have the power to, and will overwrite maps, histories, 
                languages and religions without our consent, as users. The digital world has never been decolonial; it has always been a 
                battle for representation and the Global South is being pushed to the margins, once again
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately, this is not the end. Decolonial resistance does exist in open-source mapping, coding projects and activists 
                who refuse to stay silent. My only worry though, is that we are moving towards a world where we will be silenced without 
                noticing. We do not have control over the digital internet space at large…so who is to stop these tech companies from 
                silently shadow banning us? For now, no one knows yet.
            </p>

            <p>
                Renaming the Gulf might seem minor, but it makes me wonder: what else are tech giants rewriting without anyone’s knowledge 
                or consent?
            </p>

            <p>
                -THE END-
