            <p>
                Hi! I am Star, and I am a third year university student at Wits. I am studying towards a BA in Digital Arts with a focus on
                game development, animation (most specifically 3D animation) and web development. I'm curious about integrating new technologies
                into the creative field.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose to study this degree, because at the time I was very passionate about gaming and making games. Being within the University
                space afforded me the opportunity to meet so many professional individuals, and open my eyes to much more. Now gaming isn't my only 
                focus, since I am quite interested in AI and its impacts on our society and algorithm-based technologies like social media. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Aside from that, I am also interested in kpop, otome games, app development and nail artistry. I have been a kpop fan since 2013
                when f(x)'s 'Rum Pum Pum Pum' came out, although my fangirl tendencies have cooled down over the years. I have been playing otome 
                games since 2016 and the first otome game I played was Ikemen Revolution. The trailer and music within the trailer absolutely 
                captivated me. I have been a dedicated player of otome games and visual novel games since. In terms of app development, well I just
                want the power to say "Yeah I've made an app", nonchantly in my hands. It's a dream that I plan to make a reality. Then for nail 
                artistry... well, I have always been curious about nails and dreamt of having long nails since 2015. This was mainly because I used
                to bite my nails til there was only a thin strip of nail and flesh, mainly due to stress. I only started growing my nails out in 2024 
                after my mother bought me my first of nail supplies, and ever since I have been hooked. I'd offer to do nails, but I am still building 
                my skills. Watch the space though, a website for my nail artistry might come soon.
