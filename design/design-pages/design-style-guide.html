                <h3> Colour Palettes </h3>

                <p>
                    Something that I want to maintain from my first wireframe designs (where I was exploring the potential colours of my website)
                    would most definetly be the theme of the colour palettle. The name of my site is 'Starfish Galaxy', and I wanted to go
                    for an acquatic theme in space, however, I am unsure of how I would mix colours associated with these two themes into one.
                    So.. for now, I have decided to lean more towards the space theme. I want users to feel like they're browsing through the 
                    stars as they explore my site. 
                </p>
                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/colour-palettes/primary-colour-palette.png" alt="Primary Colour Palette" 
                        width="300" height="300">
                        <figcaption> Primary colour palette</figcaption>
                    </figure>
    
                    <p>
                        A gorgeous colour scheme, if I may say so myself. I believe my colour choices are sophisticate and visually striking, they 
                        adhere to the theme, while maintaining readability and accessibility. (PLEASE note that I have not tested how these 
                        colours would work together for colour blind users. When I speak of accessibility here, I mean in terms of readability for the 
                        users.) Midnight violet (#160649) as the background gives the website an elegant, professional starry night feeling. The 
                        royal blue (#296ac8) for the interactive elements, is bold, eye-catching and helps them stand out against the dark background.
                        It makes the site feel lively without being too overwhelming. Lavender Blush (#cba1eb) is used as a soft contrast for the nav 
                        bar, scrollbar background and text within the footer. It gives the website a soft 'pop', preventing it from feeling too dark.
                        Soft aqua (#92d2f5) will be used for text to keep things readable against the dark background and the other two 
                        saturated colours (also meant to represent the 'stars shining and glowing in the galaxy'). Here is how it would
                        look when laid out:
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/wireframes/Third-Wire-Colour-Test.png" alt="Third wireframe design 
                        with primary colour palette test" width="400" height="270">
                        <figcaption> Third wireframe design with primary colour palette test</figcaption>
                    </figure>
    
                    <p>
                        There is a strong contrast between the colours I have chosen and the dark background. This will keep everything readable
                        and accessible. The interactive elements pop, making sure that users can easily identify the interactive elements.
                        There are some things I am considering though. I am worried that soft aqua wont be 'that' readable on the midnight 
                        violet background. In the test image above, it does seem like it will be readable, but I am curious about how it would look 
                        on the webpages that are very text heavy, like this webpage for instance. 
                    </p>
                </div>
      

                <p>
                    Honestly, I was worried that my webpage may be a bit jarring, with the whole 'night sky' theme. What inspired me, and 
                    convinced me to continue with this idea was <a class="u-url" href="https://bluefox.studio/"> Bluefox Studio's Website</a>
                    Their site has that feel of exploring the stars/ galaxy off the bat, without even knowing what the content in the website
                    is. I believe the dark background, and contrasting colours used for the text and other ui elements give it that feel. 
                </p>

                <h3> Fonts </h3>
                I have yet to finalise my font choices, but I do want to use fonts that evoke an ethereal yet simplistic feel. The typography 
                should complement my night-sky aesthetic while maintaining readability and a minimalistic, clean design. The reason for 
                having a clean design is because when we look up at the sky, there is cleanliness in the way the stars and things in space 
                shine above our heads. It never feels negatively overwhelming. The sky always feels beautiful, structured and awe inspiring. 
                To mirror this feeling, I am considering fonts like Raleway, Quicksand or Playfair Display as potential options.

                <h4> 14 March Update</h4>
                <p>
                    Initially I started out with crazy fonts that were not cohesive at ALL.
                </p>

                    <p> 
                        Basic webpage text (on the blogs, on the webpage the default text that will be almost everywhere) : Pompiere
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">

                        alt="Display of Fascinate font" width="390" height="115">
                        <figcaption> Display of Fascinate font </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        Interactive text (The header, the footer, the links /buttons): Fascinate
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/fonts/first-fonts/Ribeye.png" 
                        alt="Display of Ribeye font" width="390" height="115">
                        <figcaption> Display of Ribeye font </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        Website name/Logo (self explanatory): Ribeye
                    </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    The reason why I have chosen these fonts at this stage is because I felt that they resembled the different variations of my 
                    handwriting. Using them, adds a personal and intimate touch to my website because I want this website to be a reflection of 
                    myself in one way or another. The fonts all have a casual yet celestial vibe, and I do think that they fit into my ‘starry 
                    night’ theme perfectly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I realised that the interactive text is not accessible. It is a font that is meant for big, standout headings. Truthfully. 
                    I don’t want my website to be all over the place, which is why I tried to stick to three fonts. Because the ‘fascinate’ 
                    font does not scale well, and will not look good on smaller devices, I have decided to get rid of it. I am also 
                    re-considering the ‘ribeye’ font, as I feel It does not carry the same ‘simplistic’ and readable style that the pompiere 
                    font does.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since my main reasons for choosing the fonts I had before was because I felt they resembled different versions of my 
                    handwriting, I have decided to look at fonts that look like handwriting and find variations that do not go against my 
                    design goals for the website, that match the aesthetic and still add a personal touch, as a reflection of myself. If I 
                    may add: a major reason, that I have repeated throughout my posts, for having this ‘personal touch’ is to ensure that I 
                    am able to capture and reflect the awe-inducing feeling of looking up at the stars and being within my personal galaxy, 
                    where everything shown on the website reflects me (my skillset too..).

                <p>
                    After testing it on the website, I realised that it is really pretty and fits what I was aiming for, but the quirky 
                    looking strokes may just fatigue the eye, and it might not be ideal for long blog posts (which I do have).
                </p>

                    <p> 
                        For the text, I am now considering a cleaner font like Quicksand as a balance between the “handwritten” looking 
                        fonts and because it is cleaner and easier to read.

                    <p> 
                        After testing it on the website, I realised that it won’t work in the navigation bar because the text is way too thin.
                        I was considering using Patrick Hand, but decided to leave it only in the navbar and the footer, since using it all 
                        over the website made the webpages look a bit messy, crazy and unorganised.

                    <p> 
                        No problems with this font. It looks hand-written, it is soft, and personally I feel like it matches my personality. 
                        It’s also not overused, so it won’t overwhelm the users.

                    So the theme I had in mind for my site was something akin to a starry night. The images I have gathered on my moodboard all evoke a feeling of awe and wonder within me, and I wanted to try and create a site that would evoke the same response in anyone who uses it. In my moodboard I also have images of people who are reaching out to the stars or have a collection of stars in their hands. This is another thing that I want my site to “embody”. This is not just any website, this is my website, Star’s little universe; Star’s Galaxy. A collection of the works I have done and aspire to do that all add to who I am, who I was and who I will become. And the users? They’re invited into this personal universe; this galaxy is within reach for them. I do hope that the way I structure my website embodies the abstract feelings I want to invoke in the users
                </p>

                <p>
                    These visuals also served as inspiration for my colour palette and typography choices, which contributes to the overall celestial vibe I am striving for. The images of people reaching for the stars reflect how I ultimately want users to feel, like they’re exploring a piece of my universe. Every design decision I have made thus far, stems from this desire to evoke wonder and curiosity. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The background was one constant colour. I plan to have animated stars in the background but am still deciding what colour I should make them, as I need a colour that won’t interfere with the light blue text of the webpage but still be light enough to resemble stars. I designed an image for the background of my website, since I am unable to add animated stars at the moment. I made a simple night sky, using Midnight Violet(#160649) as the main colour. The stars are made with different shades of yellow, gold, blues and pinks. I like it, A LOT.

                        After receiving feedback, I realised that utilizing this background for the blog pages, essay pages and design pages 
                        where there will be a lot of writing will come in handy because I don’t want to distract my readers from the main 
                        stuff on those pages which would be the written content.

                <h3> Colour Scheme</h3>
                <p>
                    I am sticking with my current colour scheme, but I need to improve the readability of the colours working together. After 
                    analysing and receiving feedback I realised that while the royal blue colour is pretty and matches the overall aesthetic 
                    I am going for, it does not contrast well against the darker blue and the purple colour. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, after adjusting the royal blue colour, I realised that the purple colour could be a bit darker as well, to ensure 
                    that the background contrasted with the text.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I tried a lot of different things, such as a gradient background for the navigation bar and footer, and while it looked 
                    cool, it also just looked so out of place. When picking new colours for the footer and nav bar, I didn’t do anything 
                    special, I just played with the colour wheel within the css document and saved, checking which options looked the best 
                    visually, and used the ‘wave evaluation tool’ to check the contrast until it gave me a good score. The new colours I 
                    settled on, still adhere to my theme, while contrasting against one another very, very nicely.
                </p>

                    Please note that the footer appears to be a different colour but is still the same colour as the nav bar, I just played 
                    with the alpha value to make it slightly different.

                            Periwinkle Sky (#809bf7) for the nav bar links (the text), and any other interactive links within my website. 
                            Also used as the colour of the website name.
                        </li>

                            Soft Plum (#3f1754) as the background for the nav bar and the footer

                        <li>
                            Moonlit Veil (#f0f8ff) for the footer text. (And for now I am also using it as a stand in for the colour of the 
                            selected webpage within the nav bar to show users which page they’re on.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lemon Glow (#fceea7) for the hover colour of links, AND the subtle gradient for the scrollbar. I added a bit of 
                            yellow to the side scroll bar since my logo is going to be yellow, and the background image has a bit of yellow 
                            in it. It looks nice, promise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Midnight Violet (#160649) remains as the default website background
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cloud Breeze (#aeeaff) as the colour of the headings of each webpage within the website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Glacial Bubble (#9dd7f7) as the colour for the main body text.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Every pixel on my site serves a purpose on my websit, even the cursor. Why? Because details matter since I am building 
                    my own galaxy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I customised the cursors to enhance the overall feeling of immersion into my galaxy that is represented by my website. 
                    Starfish Galaxy is a space that’s meant to feel dreamy, and uniquely mine. The default system cursors felt a bit too 
                    boring and disconnected from the rest of the site’s aesthetic😤. So, to keep the user experience cohesive and visually 
                    immersive, I designed custom cursors that complement the galactic theme and give visitors that dreamy “I’m amongst the 
                    stars” feeling I’ve been trying to bring to life since day one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For both cursor designs, I used Lemon Glow (#fceea7) as the base colour. This warm, soft yellow brings a gentle glow 
                    kinda like stardust. It’s used consistently across the site in other key areas, like the glowing stars in the background, 
                    and the scrollbar, creating visual continuity and a sense of cohesion. Lemon Glow acts as a “guiding light“ through the 
                    galaxy, drawing users’ eyes without being overwhelming.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the same reasons, I used the same colours within the logo. My goal was to make every detail even the cursors, feel 
                    intentional and part of this celestial browsing experience. I wanted users to feel like they weren’t just visiting a 
                    website… but entering my personal universe. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    UNFORTUNATELY, the cursor images are very, very tiny, so the details aren’t at all visible. This is a mistake on my part, 
                    I should have saved two versions (a bigger HD version of the cursors and the small one that would be used in the website.)

                <h3> Button design</h3>
                <p>
                    When it came to the buttons, I simply decided to put them into a box, using Moonlit Veil(#f0f8ff) as the border. 
                    All the boxes on my website have this colour as the border, because it’s striking and makes the elements that are 
                    contained within it stand out. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I didn’t formally design my buttons, which was a mistake. I designed them on a whim within my css, settling on the 
                    same design for the boxed elements in my webpage. Moonlight Veil (#f0f8ff) as the border colour and Soft Plum(#3f1754) 
                    with the alpha turned down as the fill.
                </p>

                <p>
                    UNFORTUNATELY, I couldn’t decide how I wanted it to look when hovering over it and came up with three options to select 
                    from.
                </p>

                <div class="pictextContainer">

                </div>

                <p>
                    The third is the one I have set as the default, because it looks good and maintains consistency, since the hover colour 
                    for ‘text’ links are also yellow. The reason I made the gradient hover buttons was because I feared that the consistency 
                    of the yellow hover was a bit too repetitive. I do like the second option, where the white fades into the muted yellow, 
                    however, when you look at the webpage in total…it looks very out of place, while at the same time it also fits the 
                    aesthetic of the webpage.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the end, I settled on the third option for buttons within the webpage and on the second option for the ‘Back To Top’ 
                    button.

                <h3> Page Layout</h3>

                <p>
                    As I added CSS to my website, I felt that the elements within the webpage were ‘floating randomly’. Truth be told, I think 
                    I am addicted to the ‘neatness’ displayed within my wireframes and tried to achieve that by adding a subtle box shadow to 
                    most of the pages on my website.  Doing so made the website, and its elements feel a lot more structured. 
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3> Folder Structure</h3>

                <p>
                    I am grateful for all the feedback I received from my lecturers and tutors. My folder structure is good, it eats. But 
                    there are a few things that could be improved, such as the naming convention of my images folder. My image folders were 
                    called “fotos”, mainly because I thought I was being ‘quirky’ and giving my website naming conventions that were playful. 
                    While it was understandable to me, it is not industry standard, and in most cases won’t be understood by other people 
                    within the pipeline of web development. So, I changed the name of all the image folders that have the word “fotos” to 
                    images. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another thing, I was advised to do was to remove the krita and krita autosave files from my website folders because they 
                    aren’t being used directly within my website, and are just sitting, adding confusion and a mess to my structure. I 
                    wholeheartedly agreed with that and removed them as advised.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reason I had put them there initially, was because I planned to draw and create every visual on my website, whether 
                    it be images or videos, or a logo, or any other visual, since I did state that I wanted my site to display my skills and 
                    be a sort of representation of ‘my galaxy’. (If I can explain a bit further, personally it felt like cheating to me, 
                    if I used visuals that I did not create when I expect employers and clients to look at my website as a reflection of my 
                    skills… so that is why I am a bit stubborn about creating my own visuals).
                </p>

                <p>
                    That is why I kept the krita files within these separate folders within the website, just for ease of saving each image I 
                    may make. But they’ve been removed since I don’t want to overload my website with things that won’t even be visible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was also advised to compress my images, something that I hadn’t been doing after saving them, especially because I 
                    create big, High-Definition images (2970 X 2100) for the higher quality. But after discovering that Krita has an option 
                    to compress high quality PNG images, I will make use of that for any future visuals that appear on my website. After a 
                    quick google search, I found that the recommended px size for images is 1200 x 800, so when making images and visuals in 
                    Krita, I will reduce the canvas size to 1200 x 800.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ontop of this I was advised to scale down my images, since they were a bit too big, and made each webpage longer than it 
                    needed to be. 
                </p>
