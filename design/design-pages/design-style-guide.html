                <h3> Colour Palettes </h3>

                <p>
                    Something that I want to maintain from my first wireframe designs (where I was exploring the potential colours of my website)
                    would most definetly be the theme of the colour palettle. The name of my site is 'Starfish Galaxy', and I wanted to go
                    for an acquatic theme in space, however, I am unsure of how I would mix colours associated with these two themes into one.
                    So.. for now, I have decided to lean more towards the space theme. I want users to feel like they're browsing through the 
                    stars as they explore my site. 
                </p>

                    <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/colour-palettes/primary-colour-palette.png" alt="Primary Colour Palette" 
                    width="500" height="500">
                    <figcaption> Primary colour palette</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    A gorgeous colour scheme, if I may say so myself. I believe my colour choices are sophisticate and visually striking, they 
                    adhere to the theme, while maintaining readability and accessibility. (PLEASE note that I have not tested how these 
                    colours would work together for colour blind users. When I speak of accessibility here, I mean in terms of readability for the 
                    users.) Midnight violet (#160649) as the background gives the website an elegant, professional starry night feeling. The 
                    royal blue (#296ac8) for the interactive elements, is bold, eye-catching and helps them stand out against the dark background.
                    It makes the site feel lively without being too overwhelming. Lavender Blush (#cba1eb) is used as a soft contrast for the nav 
                    bar, scrollbar background and text within the footer. It gives the website a soft 'pop', preventing it from feeling too dark.
                    Soft aqua (#92d2f5) will be used for text to keep things readable against the dark background and the other two 
                    saturated colours (also meant to represent the 'stars shining and glowing in the galaxy'). Here is how it would
                    look when laid out:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/wireframes/Third-Wire-Colour-Test.png" alt="Third wireframe design 
                    with primary colour palette test" width="700" height="400">
                    <figcaption> Third wireframe design with primary colour palette test</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    There is a strong contrast between the colours I have chosen and the dark background. This will keep everything readable
                    and accessible. The interactive elements pop, making sure that users can easily identify the interactive elements.
                    There are some things I am considering though. I am worried that soft aqua wont be 'that' readable on the midnight 
                    violet background. In the test image above, it does seem like it will be readable, but I am curious about how it would look 
                    on the webpages that are very text heavy, like this webpage for instance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Honestly, I was worried that my webpage may be a bit jarring, with the whole 'night sky' theme. What inspired me, and 
                    convinced me to continue with this idea was <a class="u-url" href="https://bluefox.studio/"> Bluefox Studio's Website</a>
                    Their site has that feel of exploring the stars/ galaxy off the bat, without even knowing what the content in the website
                    is. I believe the dark background, and contrasting colours used for the text and other ui elements give it that feel. 
                </p>
