                <h3> Colour Palettes </h3>

                <p>
                    Something that I want to maintain from my first wireframe designs (where I was exploring the potential colours of my website)
                    would most definetly be the theme of the colour palettle. The name of my site is 'Starfish Galaxy', and I wanted to go
                    for an acquatic theme in space, however, I am unsure of how I would mix colours associated with these two themes into one.
                    So.. for now, I have decided to lean more towards the space theme. I want users to feel like they're browsing through the 
                    stars as they explore my site. 
                </p>
                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/colour-palettes/primary-colour-palette.png" alt="Primary Colour Palette" 
                        width="300" height="300">
                        <figcaption> Primary colour palette</figcaption>
                    </figure>
    
                    <p>
                        A gorgeous colour scheme, if I may say so myself. I believe my colour choices are sophisticate and visually striking, they 
                        adhere to the theme, while maintaining readability and accessibility. (PLEASE note that I have not tested how these 
                        colours would work together for colour blind users. When I speak of accessibility here, I mean in terms of readability for the 
                        users.) Midnight violet (#160649) as the background gives the website an elegant, professional starry night feeling. The 
                        royal blue (#296ac8) for the interactive elements, is bold, eye-catching and helps them stand out against the dark background.
                        It makes the site feel lively without being too overwhelming. Lavender Blush (#cba1eb) is used as a soft contrast for the nav 
                        bar, scrollbar background and text within the footer. It gives the website a soft 'pop', preventing it from feeling too dark.
                        Soft aqua (#92d2f5) will be used for text to keep things readable against the dark background and the other two 
                        saturated colours (also meant to represent the 'stars shining and glowing in the galaxy'). Here is how it would
                        look when laid out:
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/wireframes/Third-Wire-Colour-Test.png" alt="Third wireframe design 
                        with primary colour palette test" width="400" height="270">
                        <figcaption> Third wireframe design with primary colour palette test</figcaption>
                    </figure>
    
                    <p>
                        There is a strong contrast between the colours I have chosen and the dark background. This will keep everything readable
                        and accessible. The interactive elements pop, making sure that users can easily identify the interactive elements.
                        There are some things I am considering though. I am worried that soft aqua wont be 'that' readable on the midnight 
                        violet background. In the test image above, it does seem like it will be readable, but I am curious about how it would look 
                        on the webpages that are very text heavy, like this webpage for instance. 
                    </p>
                </div>
      

                <p>
                    Honestly, I was worried that my webpage may be a bit jarring, with the whole 'night sky' theme. What inspired me, and 
                    convinced me to continue with this idea was <a class="u-url" href="https://bluefox.studio/"> Bluefox Studio's Website</a>
                    Their site has that feel of exploring the stars/ galaxy off the bat, without even knowing what the content in the website
                    is. I believe the dark background, and contrasting colours used for the text and other ui elements give it that feel. 
                </p>

                <h3> Fonts </h3>
                I have yet to finalise my font choices, but I do want to use fonts that evoke an ethereal yet simplistic feel. The typography 
                should complement my night-sky aesthetic while maintaining readability and a minimalistic, clean design. The reason for 
                having a clean design is because when we look up at the sky, there is cleanliness in the way the stars and things in space 
                shine above our heads. It never feels negatively overwhelming. The sky always feels beautiful, structured and awe inspiring. 
                To mirror this feeling, I am considering fonts like Raleway, Quicksand or Playfair Display as potential options.
