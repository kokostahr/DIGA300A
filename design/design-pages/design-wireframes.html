                        I have already covered the beginning stages of my wireframing process in my blog post for 
                        <a href="../../blogs/academic/week-2-blog-post.html"> week 2 </a> and <a href="../../blogs/academic/week-4-blog-post.html">

                <h3> Continuing where we left off...</h3>

                As stated in my blog post for week 4, I used the simplistic design of the blog homepage as an inspiration for the rest of my wireframes.
                So far I have designed wireframes for each and every page that I want to appear on my website. Some sections, such as the sections for 
                the essays and the portfolio have a basic wireframe layout, that may change slightly as I put the relevant content into it. These basic 
                layouts will act as placeholders to indicate where content will go on each page, within each section. Let's take a look at my wireframes.
            </section>

                <h4> Blog Post Wireframes</h4>
                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/wireframes/Third-Wire-Blog-Pages-Layout-TOP.png" alt="Third wireframe design 
                        for the top of the blog posts" width="400" height="270">
                        <figcaption> Third wireframe design for the blog posts page</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        These wireframes will be used as a guideline for the structure of both the academic and personal blog posts. When 
                        creating the wireframes for the blog posts, I already had a few blog posts up on my website. I used the basic 
                        HTML structure that I had and the simlistic design of the blog homepage as inspiration while designing these 
                        wireframes. In the wireframes I have blocked out space for the blog title, a summary of the blog, the authour and 
                        the date and any thoughts I may share before delving into the content. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/wireframes/Third-Wire-Blog-Pages-Layout-BOT.png" alt="Third wireframe design 
                        for the bottom of the blog posts" width="400" height="270">
                        <figcaption> Third wireframe design for the bottom of the blog posts page</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        As I stated before, this wireframe is just an example, a guideline of how I'd like my blogposts to look if they have 
                        images or references, but not every blog post will have images and/or references at the end of the post. I want to align
                        the images to the left-hand side of the page, while the text continues alongside it on the right-hand side. This is to 
                        save space. I do not like it when there is a big block of empty white space surrounding an image. I also feel like it 
                        makes the posts feel 'shorter' since there isn't a large gap in the middle with each photo. The bottom of each blog Post
                        will have a navigation of sorts that allows the user to go to a previous blog post, to the next blog post or back to the 
                        blog homepage. This is a navigation-type feature that I've made use of all across my blog to aid with accessibility And 
                        intiutive navigation of my website. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    There is a concern I have regarding the way I drew my wireframes. Something I only realised towards the end, really. It seems
                    as though I have mistakenly created a fixed footer? I am unsure if this is a thing, but I do not imagine that it would look nice
                    once it has been applied. But in the wireframe design, it does...so it is something I will be considering. 
                </p>

                <h4> Portfolio Wireframes</h4>

                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/wireframes/Third-Wire-Portfolio-Homepage.png" alt="Third wireframe design

                        <figcaption> Third wireframe design for portfolio homepage </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The homepage for the portfolio wireframes have a navbar at the top, the side scrolling bar on the right-hand side, and a footer. 
                        These elements are maintained throughout my website, on each page for consistency. The way I have structured the portfolio homepage is 
                        to showcase previews of the most recent works of my portfolio. This is because I am assuming that anyone who comes to view my skills on
                        my site would want to see my skills at the current stage they're viewing it. There is a small link/button that I have annotated next to
                        the previews of each section of the portfolio. I plan to make this link/button say 'View More'. When the user clicks it, then it will link And
                        redirect them to a page of the relevant section of the portfolio, where they'll be able to explore all my works, from most recent to 
                        the earliest works. Allow me to provide an example of what I mean. Let's say I land on the portfolio homepage and
                        am interested in checking out Star's 2D animations. Then I will use the side scrolling bar to scroll down until I spot 
                        the "2D Animations" heading. I see three of Star's most recent works, but I'd like to see more. So i click the 
                        'view more' link/button. This link redirects me to a page titled '2D Animations' where I can browse through Star's works.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The image above shows what the relevant sections from the portfolio homepage would look like. As you can see, I've 
                        annotated that I want to have a maximum of 8 projects on each page, meaning that I would then have to consider 
                        adding a sort of navigation at the bottom of each page that allows users to move to the previous page 
                        (within the section), to the next page, to see what page they're on and the option to return
                        to the portfolio homepage. The reason why I have restricted the number of projects shown is because I don't users to 
                        have to scroll endlessly to look for a particular post. Truthfully, 8 project posts feels a bit much, 
                        since I do plan to have a preview of the project as an image or video, then a summary of it that will give the 
                        relevant dates, and details. This is something I will continue to play around with as I add more content to my website.

                <h4> Commission Wireframe</h4>
                <div class="pictextContainer">

                    <p>
                        This wireframe has a very basic blockouk. There is not much that I intend to display on the commission homepage. There is a 
                        section for the prices, and a section for the rules associated with commissioning me. Again, this design follows the very
                        neat, simplistic style that I want my website to have. The purpose of this page is straightforward and functional. The way
                        that I have chosen to structure the layout also improves readability and navigation.

                    <p>
                        As with the commisions homepage, the essay homepage is just as simplistic for effiecient navigation and readability. 
                        This essay homepage contains the titles of each academic essay, and a small summary of what the essay is about underneath
                        the title. The summary will provide a "Read more..." link that will redirect the user to the full essay on another page.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">

                    <p>
                        When designing the essay page posts, I stuck closely to the design of the portfolio project pages. Except in these 
                        wireframes, the navigation at the bottom will display: previous essay (if applicable, e.g. it won't show this on the first 
                        essay post.), next essay and back to essay homepage. Adding this navigation improves accessibility. Accessibility is the 
                        main reason why I have chosen to have this sort of navigation at the bottom of each post/page/project, as users do not have to scroll 
                        all the way up again just to access the navigation bar again.

                       The wireframe for my Design Homepage acts as blueprint for how I envision this page. While my current HTML structure does not
                       exactly match the wireframe layout structure, it still remains similar. The wireframe outlines the different sections 
                       that the design homepage will (currently) have.

                    <p>
                        The design blog/ design post wireframes are very much insipired and follow the same outline as the normal blogpost wireframes.
                        The reason why I chose to make them similar, is because I came to the conclusion that my design section would also be a sort of
                        'blog post', in the sense that I am still writing and sharing my thoughts and insights. Just like the blog pages, the design
                        pages also have a space for the authour, the date and summary of the post. Again, it is another page on my website that has a 
                        mini navigation at the bottom that allows users to move to the prvious post, the next post or back to the homepage.
