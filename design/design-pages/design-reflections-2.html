                <h3> Reflections for Assignment 2 Submission</h3>
                <h4>General Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    One thing, I felt after finishing my website was‚Ä¶ disappointment? Mostly because the new colour scheme made it look‚Ä¶so 
                    unserious. It still resembled the night sky to a degree‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt understand why it looked so‚Ä¶childish? Perhaps it 
                    is the font I chose for the site name? I had to come to terms with the fact that my website looks a bit playful, and 
                    it took a while to do so. I would like to say that my website has its own unique charm, just like me and I am happy 
                    about that because it reflects the colour palette, sticks close to the wireframing and does give a night-sky aesthetic, 
                    just like I wanted. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I no longer want a fixed navigation bar or a fixed footer. I decorated the scroll bar so people could use it. This 
                    made me realise that I would need to add a ‚Äòback to top‚Äô button on the lengthy webpages. For now, I have formatted it 
                    with HTML. Truthfully, I did not know how to make a ‚Äòscroll to top‚Äô button until I found it in the comments section 
                    of this <a class="u-url" href="https://youtu.be/QwE_M2P3CRk?si=Fr722PaS9iVwmsPE "> video </a>. 
                    Very insane, considering I was googling things like ‚Äúhow to make a scroll to top using HTML only.‚Äù Then only got 
                    results that included Html, CSS and JAVASCRIPT! I am so thankful that I came across the comment.

                    <p>
                        @Tegotypunikos is unironically my knight in shining armour. Saved me an unnecessary headache of implementing JS 
                        then having to explain why I did it. 
                    </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    In designing the footer, I made a conscious choice to avoid overcrowding it with redundant information. I didn‚Äôt 
                    see the need to repeat the major webpage links, since the navbar is consistently present across all pages and I‚Äôve 
                    included a ‚ÄúBack to Top‚Äù button on most pages for fast navigation. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for my contact details, they‚Äôre already available on my homepage, in my profile, and I plan to add them to my 
                    commissions page. So, the thought of adding them to the footer (which is present on every page) felt unnecessary 
                    and redundant. I wanted the footer to feel clean, slightly comedic (like a nice ending to each webpage) and 
                    remain aesthetically in sync with the rest of the ‚Äòcleanish, simple‚Äô layout rather than it becoming a dumping 
                    ground for excess info.

                <h4>Reflections on implementing CSS elements</h4>
                <p>
                    Truthfully, at the beginning, this process had me going ‚ÄúWHY is this so hard!? Why is it SO confusing? WHY won‚Äôt 
                    elements apply?!‚Äù Only to realise that I was making the process 10 times harder for myself because I kept resorting 
                    to South African-British English spelling for items such as ‚Äòcolor‚Äô and ‚Äòcenter‚Äô. I pondered and lost sleep over the 
                    fact that none of the colour and alignment elements I had included were working, and it turned out to be such a 
                    simple issue. Spelling. What a disadvantage, but it is something I am conscious of. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also forgot to link a lot of the stylesheets at the top of each page, or would make changes on say, for example, 
                    the blogpage stylesheet, then refresh my browser expecting to see the changes within the design section. Really these 
                    were just simple, innocent mistakes that drove me crazy and made me lose a lot of time. But I‚Äôm grateful to have 
                    experience them, because I am now very conscious of these issues first. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    While refining the user interface across multiple pages, I encountered a bug where my ‚ÄúBack to Top‚Äù button‚Äôs hover b
                    ackground (a gradient colour) JUST mysteriously vanished whenever I hovered over it, leaving only a border and NO visual 
                    feedback. Initially, I thought it was a syntax issue within my HTML, but after confirming the CSS worked on other pages, 
                    I realised the issue seemed to be page-specific.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This made me to Google things like "CSS gradient background not showing on hover" and "CSS elements overriding each other".
                    While, I discovered a detailed explanation of the z-index property from freeCodeCamp‚Äôs website, 
                    <a class="u-url" 
                    href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/z-index-in-css-what-it-is-and-what-it-does/#:~:text=Z%20Index%20(%20z%2Dindex%20),%2C%20or%20position%3Afixed%20."> 
                    here </a>. Now I know that z-index is a CSS element used to control the stacking order of overlapping elements, and that 
                    it only works on elements that have a position value set (like relative, absolute, or fixed).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my case, a layout container was unintentionally overlapping the button, blocking the hover effect. The button was 
                    already using position: fixed, so adding a higher z-index value (I made it 9999 just to be sure ü§£ ü§£) ensured that it 
                    stacked above all other elements. Once applied, the hover gradient reappeared!
                </p>

                <p>
                    To be honest, I didn‚Äôt even realise that stacking was something to consider, but this tiny, very annoying issue 
                    reinforced the importance of knowing and understanding how stacking and positioning work and interact in CSS, especially 
                    when making layered UIs. It also reminded me that seemingly visual bugs often have deeper structural causes and that 
                    Googling smartly is still one of the best tools in a developer‚Äôs toolbox. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite all of this, when it came to adding CSS to my website, well once I figured out how to do things, I initially 
                    went a bit crazy but toned it down‚Ä¶eventually. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    One thing I realised, is that the images within my blog posts are quite small, and it‚Äôs hard to read the information. 
                    So I made it so that when a user hovers over them, the images scale up.
                </p>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">
                <h4>Reflection on HTML structure</h4>

                <p>
                    As I worried, I had to end up tweaking the structure of my NAV bar on each page just so I could have the nav bar match 
                    the wireframe design. I also had to add a figure tag for the logo, next to the site name. My only issue is, if the image 
                    is a logo, does it still need to be in a figure tag? Just for safety, I included it into it, but did not add a figcaption 
                    tag. When doing my CSS, I added a lot more microformatting to each page, just for the ease of styling. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the end, I had to go in and use flexbox a lot of times for all my blog posts and design related posts so that I could 
                    format them to fit the wireframe. In my wireframe, the images are on the left side of the screen and the writing is just 
                    beside it, on the right-hand side. I didn‚Äôt want to have to repeat this step multiple times. So, for the paragraphs where 
                    this happens, I made a class called ‚ÄúpictextContainer‚Äù. Before I said I wouldn‚Äôt use the div tag, mainly because I 
                    didn‚Äôt know what to use it for. But after researching, I found that most use it as a container to store html for the 
                    ease of CSS and Javascript. That is the main reason why I have used the div tags. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    After learning how to use flexboxes, I used them, almost everywhere on my website. Flexboxes hate to see me coming. 
                    A tutorial that helped me immensely with figuring out this element is this one: 
                    <a class="u-url" href="https://youtu.be/phWxA89Dy94?si=_aeYcf5K4QyuXNyz"> this one. </a>
                     
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used a flexbox and the overflow-x element to try and make a ‚Äòmock carousel‚Äô on my index homepage. Unfortunately, it
                     did not work out... because I didn‚Äôt populate it enough ü§£ü§£, but the format I have set up in the HTML and CSS show 
                     the kind of idea I meant to implement. (I did implement it‚Ä¶it just doesn‚Äôt show because I need to add more things.) 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Speaking of the homepage, I decided to keep the cat text emoji‚Ä¶because it feels very characteristic to the ‚Äòplayful‚Äô edge 
                    my website has. Please don‚Äôt hate on her. 
                </p>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">
                <h4>Reflections on populating my portfolio page:</h4>
                <p>
                    My whole website is built around showcasing my portfolio and my skills. 
                    I managed to figure out how to embed videos into my portfolio, since I do have a YouTube channel. I also took screenrecorded videos of other elements I wanted to showcase in my portfolio. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    Concerning the games I have made, I honestly don‚Äôt know how to embed them into the website as ‚Äòplayable‚Äô and if it is 
                    good idea to, because my website is meant to be a portfolio website and not a gaming website. In the end I decided to 
                    also just take screenrecorded videos of gameplay. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It would be easier if I could link the users to another website such as itch.io or make another website where my games 
                    are playable‚Ä¶but this is something I can start considering towards the end because it doesn‚Äôt directly affect the design 
                    of my website. It does however indirectly affect my website, because it meant to showcase everything that I have done,
                     and the skills that I want potential clients and employers to see IMMEDIATLEY.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I wanted to include some short footage of the animations I have and gameplay of games I have made, so that it wouldn‚Äôt 
                    just be a stagnant image. I wanted a snippet of the video to showcase the feel of each project that I have on display. 
                </p>

                <p>  
                    Of course, I didn‚Äôt know how to do this so I researched a bit and found a tutorial for adding local videos
                    <a class="u-url" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/h51jaPt5A5s?si=Nd2uGSJkwxiq1PT9"> here </a>,
                    and a tutorial for embedding videos from YouTube into the website,
                    <a class="u-url" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en"> here </a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing I‚Äôd like to note is that my portfolio page currently does not follow the wireframe design I have for it. I 
                    think it is the only page on my website that does not follow the wireframe design. I haven‚Äôt abandoned the wireframe 
                    design, not at all, but currently I am worried that I may be burying my portfolio items too deeply within my website. 
                    So far, I have only added a few pieces that I am proud of and plan to get advice regarding sectioning my portfolio page 
                    and having other pages that focus solely on those sections. It honestly sounds like it may be a bit too much, and I may 
                    need to look at scaling down the kinds of things that I want to showcase on my website. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly to the images within my blog posts, I set the portfolio items to enlarge when a user hovers over them so they 
                    can see the items clearly.

                <h4>Reflection on Responsive Design.</h4>
                <p>
                    This was probably the most tedious task I had to do, and I regret saving it for last. The tutorial I watched 
                    <a class="u-url" href="https://youtu.be/ZYV6dYtz4HA?si=Ht2ZGYVKXkDcZF4o "> here </a>, explicitly said how important it 
                    is for a web developer to know of responsive design before they start building their website. The YouTuber also mentioned 
                    that its easier to start coding for a mobile device first then moving towards bigger devices like tablets and PCs. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not so great for me, as I did this LAST! Truth be told after watching a few minutes of the tutorial and getting an idea on 
                    what I had to do, I just ran with it. I picked out the necessary values for each element simply through trial and error. 
                    I‚Äôd pick one, test it, if it works, then yay! If not, then I returned to my CSS file and tried another value.

                    <p> 
                        It was quite difficult to scale the glowing cards both in my index homepage and portfolio homepage down. They just 
                        wouldn‚Äôt fit into the box shadow of both webpages, and I was quite stumped. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do except 
                        to keep resizing the margin and padding of both page‚Äôs elements. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    While all the other pages managed to scale properly, there is just something wrong with my portfolio and profile pages. 
                    I am unsure if there is something wrong with the HTML code‚Äôs of both pages that kind of ignore the styling that I do in 
                    the main CSS file, Or if there is something wrong within the CSS of both pages, because even when I attempt to do 
                    responsive design within their individual stylesheets‚Ä¶. It is completely ignored‚Ä¶.I actually have no idea how to fix 
                    these two pages‚Ä¶especially the profile page. It is completely broken when in mobile view. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    No matter what I tried for the portfolio, nothing came right, specifically for the intro card 
                </p>
