                    Starfish Galaxy was the first full (kinda) website I've ever created... and it showsüòÖ! It‚Äôs not perfect, 
                    especially in terms of accessibility for slower networks, but it‚Äôs a huge milestone for me. I‚Äôm walking away 
                    with lessons in structure, interactivity, semantic HTML, and the real meaning of performance. It‚Äôs only the beginning.
                    And I am truly grateful that I got to learn from, and share this experience with my lecturers and tutors. ‡™ú‚ÅÄ‚û¥ ‚ô°

                <p>
                    When I started jotting down ideas for my website, I honestly had no clear vision of what it would 
                    eventually look like, let alone how I would actually build it from scratch. The process felt daunting 
                    at first, and I was not sure where to start or how to bring my ideas to life. Thankfully, with the 
                    guidance and support of the tutors and lecturers, I was able to ask questions, tackle challenges and 
                    slowly piece together a website that I am proud of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for everything. 
                </p>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">  
                <h4>Folder Structure:</h4>
                <p>
                   When setting up my website folder, I aimed to mirror the hierarchical information structure of my content. 
                   I wanted to ensure that everything was as organised as it could possibly be. Each section of the website, 
                   such as the Portfolio, Essay, Design and Blogs has its own dedicated folder that allowed me to separate 
                   any thematic concerns I may have encountered. Even within these sectioned folders, I still maintained a 
                   clear separation of folders and layers. For example, within the Design folder:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A dedicated folder for the HTML design blogs
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A CSS folder which managed the visual layer for the html pages within the Design folder that differed, 
                        e.g. the design homepage versus the design reflection page.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        A JavaScript folder that functioned in the same way as the CSS folder, but this time for JavaScript.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                   This setup follows a modular and scalable pattern. After a bit of guidance, I ensured that my naming 
                   conventions were clear and consistent, using lowercase, sometimes with hyphens, which also helped me 
                   navigate and update the site efficiently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    May I also note that, while I do think my folder structure was organised and well planned it, it did prove 
                    to be a challenge to work with, when it came to adding JavaScript interactivity, such as a dynamic navigation 
                    bar, on the files that were two folders deep. Unfortunately, despite my efforts, I could not figure out how 
                    to fix my navigation bar on the pages two folders deep . Despite my best efforts, I could not resolve the 
                    issue of the navigation bar failing to work and load correctly on those pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I was advised to use templates elements instead of writing HTML directly in my JS files, I found 
                    that this approach only added more confusion. I attempted to implement templates as suggested but they 
                    didn‚Äôt resolve my navigation issues, in fact they made things worse by introducing even more complications 
                    to my existing file structure. Eventually‚Ä¶out of honest frustration (and an existential crisis), I decided 
                    to leave the template method out and focus on a solution that at least partially worked for my website, even 
                    if it was not the most optimal one. Sometimes‚Ä¶survival trumps elegance.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">
                <h4>Semantic Markup</h4>
                <p>
                    My site structure leverages semantic HTML to make the content meaningful to both users and browsers. I have 
                    used appropriate tags like ‚Äòsection‚Äô, ‚Äòfigure‚Äô, ‚Äòfigcaption‚Äô, ‚Äòarticle‚Äô and ‚Äònav‚Äô to define the interface 
                    elements and improve readability. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This enhances usability and accessibility, especially for screen readers, by giving better 
                    context to assistive technologies. For instance, using ‚Äòfigcaption‚Äô in my Portfolio helps provide
                    descriptive support for visual media, while ‚Äòheader‚Äô and ‚Äòmain‚Äô help in structuring the page layout semantically. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  At first ,I avoided the use of div tags because I did not know where and how to use them, but 
                  once I started implementing JavaScript, I made use of ‚Äòdivs‚Äô to define containers that would be 
                  manipulated in some way in JS, like the carousel on my homepage or the lightbox container on my portfolio.   
                </p>
            </section>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">
                <h4>Metadata</h4>
                <p>
                   I included essential metadata in my HTML ‚Äòhead‚Äô to help browsers interpret my website correctly. I 
                   did not go too overboard, and included detailed descriptions of each page, and tagged myself as the 
                   uthor for them all. The current metadata setup effectively guides browsers in rendering the site for 
                   users on various devices. 
                </p>
            </section>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">
                <h4>CSS</h4>
                <p>
                   All my styling is handled through external CSS files; I made sure to avoid in-line styling. Each content 
                   section has its own stylesheet and while there is some duplication across files (especially with base 
                   typography or layout), this allowed me to slightly tweak visual elements to match each section‚Äôs tone.
                </p>

                <p>
                     I used flex and grid systems for layout (especially my picText container which I am especially proud of) 
                     and used media quries to ensure responsiveness across device types. My stylesheets follow a variable-based 
                     approach for consistency, and I also tried to maintain flexibility for any design customisation that I had 
                     for the blog, design, portfolio, profile and essay pages.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section data-type="thoughts and reflection-and-thoughts">
                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>
                   I used JavaScript to introduce dynamic, reusable features, like the bottom navigation on the blog, design 
                   and essay pages. 
                </p>

                <p>
                     I received feedback about ‚Äúcode duplication‚Äù and ‚Äúwriting everything in a global scope,‚Äù. Yes, some 
                     JavaScript was duplicated across content sections. This was not due to a lack of modular thinking, but 
                     rather a deliberate organisational decision I made. Each section has a different set of pages, so 
                     although the script structure is similar, the data arrays and navigation behaviours differ, meaning a 
                     one-size fits all script would not have worked out of the box without conditional complexity, that would 
                     have confused me even further and degraded the readability of my code. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   Here's why the setup worked for me:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each script was tailored to its section‚Äôs content, maintaining UX consistency while offering users 
                        unique data.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It fit my folder structure cleanly: scripts were scoped to the folders they belonged to. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I avoided inline scripting and used ‚ÄòDOMContentLoaded‚Äô events responsibly to encapsulate interactivity
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Still, I acknowledge that the code structure could benefit from modular imports and exports, and hope to 
                  implement, using JavaScript modules in future projects‚Ä¶or iterations of this website. Refactoring repeated 
                  logic into shared utility functions and minimising global scope, are areas I now recognise as areas for improvement.   
                </p>

                <p>  
                    I also received feedback regarding my use of variable declarations. Initially I mixed ‚Äòvar‚Äô,‚Äôconst‚Äô and 
                    ‚Äòlet‚Äô depending on what ‚Äúfelt right‚Äù, and may have still done the same thing within my latest iterations. 
                    I still do get confused between each variable but do know that through practical application, I am learning 
                    to understand the importance of choosing the right declaration for each variable‚Äôs purpose. In future 
                    projects, I will stick to ‚Äòconst‚Äô for constant variables and leave ‚Äòlet‚Äô for variables that truly need it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used JS in my website to make interactive features like :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The lightbox gallery for viewing my portfolio items,
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Filtering the different items in my portfolio
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Navigation buttons on blog-like and essay pages
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        And a carousel on my homepage
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    All my scripting is also done in external JS files, and I made sure to avoid inline scripting. And I tried 
                    to clean up a lot of the comments in my code for the final submission, for clarity and readability

                <h4>General Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                   Creating Starfish Galaxy was a huge learning curve in both design and development. While I had strong, initial 
                   goals around making my website accessible to everyone, reality hit me a bit harder than expected.
                </p>

                    <p> 
                        I am, honestly, a bit disheartened by that discovery, but also‚Ä¶I want to give myself grace, because it is my 
                        first website, ever. And I know that every mistake is a chance to learn. This experience has shown me that 
                        accessibility is not just about semantic HTML or ensuring that my website‚Äôs colours contrast well, but it 
                        is also about the load times, the file sizes and the content prioritisation. These are things that I will 
                        absolutely work on improving as I build more sites in the future

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                   Creating Starfish Galaxy was not only a journey of visual and interactive design, it was also a lesson on how 
                   user experience influences code structure. I did my best to balance UI customisation, semantic accuracy, 
                   responsive design and interactive elements, while also learning how to code in JavaScript. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am truly proud of what I have built, and even more excited about how I‚Äôll improve in future projects.
