                <h3> Reflections for Assignment 1 Submission</h3>
                <p>
                    As I continue to refine my website, there are a few areas that are not yet structured exactly as
                    planned in my wireframes. One of the key difference is my homepage layout. In my wireframe, I designed a 
                    carousel to showcase my latest works but I haven't structure this in the HTML yet because I am still 
                    figuring the best way to...implement it. I want the carousel to be smooth, interactive and eyecatching, but
                    I need to explore the right approach before intergrating it into my code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another element that remains incomplete is my footer. Right now, it does not contain any information 
                    because I am still considering what I want to include. Should I put copyright information? Should I quicklinks 
                    to the major pages? Should it have my contact details? Or all of the above? I want it to be informative, but 
                    also don't want it to feel too clutter or take away from the overall aesthetic and design of my website. I 
                    plan to book consultations and gather feedback on what content would add necessary value without overwhelming 
                    the design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly, the deliberate choice I made was to EXCLUDE my location from my profile section. I understand that adding 
                    it could be benefical for microformatting and potential opportunities, but currently I am not comfortable with 
                    displaying my location on my site at this time... It is something I may reconsider in the future, but for now, I
                    want to keep that information private.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, there are still many aspects of my website that need refining, but I am taking a thoughtful approach to 
                    each design (I hope). As I continue this process I will experiment with different solutions and get feedback to 
                    ensure the final design aligns with my vision and usability goals. Thank you!
                    Hope you enjoyed exploring the first structure of my website.
                </p>
