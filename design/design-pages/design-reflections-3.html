                <h3> Reflections for Assignment 3 Submission</h3>
                <h4>General Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development of my website, I experienced a full range of emotions‚Ä¶ I was excited, frustrated, 
                    growing in my coding skill but towards the end I just felt self-doubt. My goal from the start was to create a 
                    space that felt true to me: playful, visually unique and personal. I really wanted my website to reflect my 
                    creativity and identity, even if it didn‚Äôt match a more ‚Äòminimalist‚Äô or ‚Äòprofessional‚Äô approach that I mainly saw.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coming from a Unity background, and being more familiar with C#, made learning JavaScript very weird. It was like 
                    being dropped in a Galaxy that was not mine. I kept asking myself things like ‚ÄúWhere is the Start function? How 
                    do I call the functions I create?‚Äù The language felt very foreign and chaotic. Especially when it came to numbers, 
                    strings and objects. What do you mean you can just add these three different things into one variable, as if we 
                    are making some kind of evil potion ü§®.
                </p>

                <p>
                     There were moments where I honestly wanted to try everything on my own (ambitious), and stay away from YouTube 
                     tutorials and AI tools. I really wanted to build everything from scratch and my own understanding of the logic. 
                     But if I am being honest, I relied on YouTube tutorials heavily, and the ai tools for in-depth explanations. This 
                     isn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt try, but because I felt like the foundational knowledge I got was not enough. Still I 
                     managed to learn A LOT by translating basic tutorials into my website, making them (somehow) fit and work. It 
                     was difficult at first because most tutorials started with empty html, css and js pages, and did not use things 
                     like ‚ÄòDOMContentLoaded‚Äô so when my JS was not working, I had to research and find out why. These moments 
                     specifically made me realise that I couldn‚Äôt JUST copy-paste YouTubers codes‚Ä¶ (although towards the end of 
                     submission, I got so frustrated and tired, and wished I just could). However this added to my growth process. 
                     For me, this is when things started clicking. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   A huge part of me is very, very nervous that I will forget the things I did in JS, which tutorials I watched and how 
                   I managed to make all things work. So I left a few (or a lot) of comments for my future self and to help the 
                   examiner understand what I was trying to do with my first sad yet‚Ä¶brave attempt at making things more dynamic and 
                   interactive with JS. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Despite that, I managed to implement all the things that I wanted to implement, even if it isn‚Äôt flawless (yet). 
                    I also added some subtle background animations with JS. I hope to make them more striking after this submission. I 
                    just did this to give the website a bit more of a ‚Äòvibe‚Äô and make it ‚Äòfeel‚Äô intergalactic‚Ä¶ not sure if I just 
                    made it too busy now. ü§£
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the main challenges I faced in general was making the site responsive. Yes, it still has some of the same 
                    issues related to responsiveness as the last submission. But it‚Äôs not AS bad ü§£. Building a hamburger menu that 
                    worked across devices made me understand responsive design and media queries, CSS positioning and how JS can 
                    tie everything together, much more. I now know what to look for when something breaks. (I was proud when I 
                    managed to fix my carousel). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    An unexpected source of discouragement and frustration was that class spreadsheet, which had everyone websites. 
                    While the intention behind it may have been transparency and shared inspiration, it also unintentionally created a 
                    space where ideas‚Ä¶and personal structures could start to feel a bit‚Ä¶recycled. It was sometimes (most times) 
                    disheartening to notice similarities across a lot of projects, especially when striving to design something 
                    original and personal. However, it also served as a reminded of how important it is to stay focused on my own 
                    creative goals and continue refining my ideas, even when inspiration flows both ways üôÇ. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    My website still feels ‚Äòchildish‚Äô to me, especially when compared to others, but I still see it as uniquely mine. 
                    It a cute, sparkling reflection of who I am right now, and that‚Äôs something I am proud of at least. It‚Äôs not the 
                    final version of me or my skills, but hey, it‚Äôs a good start, right? 
                </p>

                <h4>Changes Made</h4>
                <p>
                   One of the first major changes I made was replacing the original profile image on my ‚ÄòProfile-About Me‚Äô page. The 
                   initial image was a simple, smiling drawn representation of myself. I decided to switch to a more cosmic, aethetic 
                   representation that better fit the overall theme of my website. I am MUCH happier with this version, as it aligned 
                   more closely with the dreamy, star-filled design I was going for.  I also tried to co-ordinate the image with my 
                   website‚Äôs colour scheme to ensure visual consistency on all pages. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  As I learned more about JavaScript, I took the time to step back and crtically examine my website. I wanted 
                  the implementation of JavaScript interactivity to feel intentional, and not forced, so I focused on areas that 
                  would benefit from it, mainly the navigation and gallery experiences. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some of the JS features I planned to include:
                </p>
                <ul class="deco">
                    <li>
                        A carousel feature on the homepage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A bottom navigation bar for blog-like pages
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updated nav bar links for smoother transitions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A portfolio gallery filter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Replacing hover effects in the portfolio with a lightbox-style viewer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Animated stars in the background using a particle effect
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DOM manipulation to display recent works dynamically on the homepage
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                   I did not manage to complete all the features within the timeframe (my faultüòÇ). The ‚ÄòLatest Works‚Äô carousel on 
                   the homepage is currently hard-coded into the HTML, since I didn‚Äôt manage to implement the dynamic update 
                   functionality with JavaScript yet. I also decided not to remove the hover effect from my portfolio, its still 
                   active on desktop view because, it‚Äôs nice. I also have not implemented the filtering system yet, but the lightbox 
                   feature for viewing my work, was added successfully. I will add filters later though.

                <h4>Coding the Back To Top Button</h4>
                <p>
                    I started off by using a tutorial on youtube to frame my foundation 
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/SJVCvnKM_lI?si=aiWLINtAVO-r3Rtc ">This</a> is the tutorial I started off with. 
                    Even though I followed this tutorial, a part of me couldn‚Äôt help but feel that it was an outdated method, 
                    which in the end turned out to be UNTRUE. At first it did not work out and I couldn‚Äôt really understand why. 
                    After getting some feedback, I decided to try the method by making my back to top button, an actual button in 
                    the HTML, and by calling the function within the button, in my JS file, in hopes that it would actually workout that time.
                </p>

                 <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/reflection-screenshots/third-reflection-images/initial-bactToTop-with-CSS-HTML.png" 
                        alt="screenshot of the hard-coded back to top button html code" width="390" height="170">
                        <figcaption>Screenshot of the hard-coded back to top button html code</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        For reference, this is how I initially created my back to top button in the HTML code. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/reflection-screenshots/third-reflection-images/intial-coding-for-backToTop.png" 
                        alt="screenshot of the first attempt at coding the back to top functionality in JavaScript" width="390" height="170">
                        <figcaption>Screenshot of the first attempt at coding the back to top functionality in JavaScript</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        And this is how I did the JavaScript code, following the tutorial I watched. In the end, I put the code into a 
                        function and changed the anchor tag in the HTML to a button. 
                        Used <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-an-unobtrusive-scroll-to-top-button/">this</a> site  for 
                        assistance. In the end, I realised that none of my functions were working out because I did not store them in 
                        a DOMcontentloaded element. This means that my JS was running at the same time my HTML and CSS were running 
                        (when the page is refreshed), so the JS wouldn‚Äôt find the necessary elements in the HTML because they had not 
                        loaded yet. The DOMcontentloaded element-function, stopped this from happening by enusuring that the JS 
                        functions I did, waited until the HTML pages were done loading. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">

                        alt="screenshot of the back to top button html code with the anchor tag removed and replaced with a button tag" width="390" height="170">

                            anchor tag removed and replaced with a button tag</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        The html coding for the back to top button did not really change in the end; I just chaned the anchor tag to a button tag.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>

                    <p> 
                        And added a few more tricks to the JavaScript code so that the button would be inactive when the user is 
                        at the top of the page, then appear as they scroll down. If you look at the code, its much longer now. The 
                        image below, shows just how much the back to top button changed. Glad I could code it in JS.

                <h4>Making a Dynamic Navigation Bar</h4>
                <p>
                   What a tough process. I thought it would be as simple as making the bottom navigation for the blog pages, but 
                   did not consider that I would have to take folder structure and all those juicy things into account.

                    <p> 
                        I managed to make it work on the main pages that are in the nav bar, but anything else two folders deep‚Ä¶ well

                    <p> 
                       After fixing it and ensuring that it worked (even if it only works on the major homepages), I realised that 
                       when you load my website from the github link, then the homepage isn‚Äôt highlighted as the active page, because 
                       the path in the search bar‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt have the /index.html/, as shown in the screenshot.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                       Home, in the nav bar isn‚Äôt recognised as the active page because of this, so it is still clickable. Once 
                       clicked, then it is recognised as the homepage as the path in the searchbar changes too. This is an issue I 
                       will get assistance with, because at this stage I am unsure how I would add both links‚Ä¶to be recognised as 
                       the homepage into the HTML embedded within my JS code.

                <h4>Changing up the Portfolio</h4>
                <p>
                   I started out by using <a href="https://youtu.be/zGUESwggf-M?si=H86frSwsgxS7Sdla">this</a> YouTube tutorial. I 
                   essentially redid the layout of my portfolio, and did a grid sort of layout within CSS (changed it from a flexbox) 
                   so that it would be easier to read. I wanted to remove the summary underneath each portfolio item and ensure that 
                   when the user clicked on it, then it would enlargen, fit the screen, and display the summary paragraph underneath. 
                   This is how the code looked initially when I tried to make it work T^T:
                </p>
                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/reflection-screenshots/third-reflection-images/jscoding-screenshot-lightboxgallery-one.png" 
                        alt="First screenshot of the broken JavaScript coding for making the portfolio's gallery-lightbox" width="390" height="270">
                        <figcaption>First screenshot of the broken JavaScript coding for making the portfolio's gallery-lightbox</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/reflection-screenshots/third-reflection-images/jscoding-screenshot-lightboxgallery-two.png" 
                        alt="Second screenshot of the broken JavaScript coding for making the portfolio's gallery-lightbox" width="390" height="270">

                    </figure>>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Of course, this did not work at first.  And it was a hassle; I was so unsure how to fix this. But eventually I 
                    tweaked the code to open up the figure and not try to open up each individual video? So basically, I made it so 
                    that the user could click anywhere on the figure and the image would open up. And this change did help the lightbox 
                    open up, but I still couldn‚Äôt figure out why the previous, back and close buttons were not working.
                </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        In my console, I got so many random errors that I did not even know of, as shown in the picture. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                   I had a feeling that these errors were conflicting with my site and making the lightbox button functionality‚Ä¶well, 
                   broken. I put this image into an AI just for clarification and it let me know that these errors related to 
                   adblockers? Very random because my Chrome does not have an adblocker‚Ä¶.  
                </p>

                <p>
                   NONETHELESS! I didn‚Äôt give up and tried to debug the code (yes on my own). I noticed an error in the console 
                   relating to the youtube video I was trying to add to the lightbox. (I didn‚Äôt manage to take a screenshot of it), 
                   and simply went into my code, and took a guess, then commented out all, AND the lightbox worked!

                        (I apologise for the drastic theme change in my VS Code. Changing the themes, was something I found myself 
                        impulsively doing when stressed.)

                <p>
                    It was a tough to figure out the issues relating to this lightbox, but now that I know, I am excited to use it 
                    elsewhere in my website!

                <h4>Making the Homepage Carousel</h4>
                <p>
                   I made silly mistakes when making the basic carousel. I forgot to change the appearance of each item in the 
                   carousel, which ended up with it looking like the image below.
                </p>

                <div class="pictextContainer">
                    <figure>
                        <img class="u-photo" src="../design-images/reflection-screenshots/third-reflection-images/broken-caro-homepage.png" 
                        alt="Screenshot of the basic carousel looking very busted and broken." width="390" height="220">
                        <figcaption>Screenshot of the basic carousel looking very busted and broken.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p> 
                        At this stage the carousel was broken, the previous and next buttons did not work. Honestly, I made a silly 
                        mistake, I just forgot to link the relevant script at the top of the document, but after doing so, my basic 
                        carousel worked WELL! In terms of the shaping, all I had to do was change a few things within the CSS code 
                        relating to height, width and background, and it worked out.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This whole JavaScript process was not easy. There were too many moments of frustration, confusion and missed sleep. 
                    But as I stated before, through this all, I have grown in the way I approaching learning (especially when it comes 
                    to coding languages). My website isn't perfect, but hey, its a reflection of my growth, my grit and honestly for 
                    now that is more than enough. 
                </p>
