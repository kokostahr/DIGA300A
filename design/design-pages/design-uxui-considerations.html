                    I have already discussed my UI and UX considerations within <a href="../../blogs/academic/week-3-blog-post.html"> 
                    week 3's </a> blog post. In this post, I will go a bit more in-depth with that. 
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3> User Experience Goals</h3>

                <p>
                    As stated in week 3's blog post, my website is designed to cater to two main groups of people:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        potential employers who are looking for an overview of my skills, want to see my projects and 
                        experience
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        clients who may be intereste din commisioning work from me.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When users open my site, I want them to have a smooth and intuitive experience, where they're able to
                    easily find the information they need. My homepage should immediately establish my identity as a developer, 
                    an animator and a designer. I want to ensure that users visiting my site are able to find what they need 
                    without unnecessary hassle or clutter. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every page has a fixed navigation bar that it easy to access, while sections with multiple pages have a 
                    small nav menu at the bottom of the page that allows them to view the previous post, to view the next Post
                    or to return back to the relevant homepage. I have tried my best to break the information into distinct 
                    sections so that I don't overwhelm the user by having too many different things on one page. One thing I 
                    am concerned about, however, is that I am burying important content under many layers. I am afraid since
                    key content may be more than three clicks away from the intial starting homepage. 
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3> User Interface Goals</h3>

                <p>
                    I have tried my best to maintain consistency with my wireframes and html structure in the 
                    current state (17 March 2025) of my website, to ensure that each user, whether they're my target 
                    audience or not, can navigate my website smoothly without hassle or distraction. Each section has 
                    its purpose on my website: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The homepage introduces me (in a way...) and guides users to the relvant sections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The blog section captures my thoughts, my reflections and learning process, especially 
                        within the academic blogs secton.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The design section showcases the development of my design process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the portfolio and commissions sections are specifically designed for potential
                        clients.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Every page I have within my website has a header and footer. Within the header, is 
                    a navigation bar. The structure of my navigation bar remains the same throughout all pages
                    to ensure that users always know where they are and how to return to other sections.
