                    So, in this blog post I will be discussing my 
                    design process, the evolution of my wireframes 
                    and how  UX, UI and IxD influenced the decisions I made.

                <h3>Wireframing Process </h3>
                <p>
                    My wireframing process is still in the process of being developed. As I said in Week 2’s blog post, 
                    I wanted my website to reflect the sleek, simple aesthetic that tech websites like Samsung’s website uses. 
                    I mainly took inspiration from their layout, and the way they use space.

                <h3> First Round Of Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
                When I Started designing my initial wireframes, I was too focused on colours, and creating a colour scheme that matches 
                with the theme that I had for the website, and was focused on making the website look aesthetic, without considering the 
                user interaction, or if the stuff I wanted displayed on my homepage had any reason to be there.    
            </p>

            <p>
                The first wireframes I have are identical in structure, the only change is the colour scheme. Regarding the colour scheme, 
                I wanted a site that felt reminiscent of the sky (Since I go by Star, and the site is named ‘Star’s Galaxy’.) I wanted the 
                site to give the user a feeling as if they were exploring one of the many galaxies out there, or looking up at the sky, 
                and ‘studying’ each star in the sky. In the case of my website, every user interaction such as clicking a button or link 
                would represent that ‘star’ that the user is ‘studying’
            </p>
            
            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week4-images/week4-1st-wireframes-colours.png" alt="Star's first wireframe design"
                    width="500" height="240">
                    <figcaption> Colour variation of Star's first wireframe designs </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    If you look at my first four wireframes, you can see that the structure remained the same. Looking back at this, I can see that 
                    there’s quite a lot of redundant information, such as the ‘short headline about myself’ and ‘short about me + link to full about 
                    me page’. It’s very clear that here I did not consider the readability of my wireframes, nor did I consider IxD. I used the space 
                    quite badly, and frankly did not know what I was doing. My thoughts at the time were to ‘cram as much information as I possibly could’ onto the homepage to ensure that whatever the user wanted to find would be easily accessible. I did not consider the fact that this might be overwhelming for the user, and make my website homepage look very, very messy. The colours are also strange, now that I am looking back on it. I know that I wanted to incorporate my favourite colour: pink, into the colour scheme, and I must say the first wireframe (pink and blue-black) looks the best. The rest have colours that clash, and the orange and blue wireframe looks the worst, mainly because of the readability. The white text against the light blue background was a terrible idea. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>

                     <figcaption> Star's first wireframes but the layout is slighty different </figcaption>
                </figure>
    
                <p>
                    In the two other versions I made of the wireframes, I was starting to consider how I organised information on my homepage, 
                    specifically for the ‘Featured/Latest Works’ section. This was to try and tidy up how the homepage looked, but as you can see, 
                    there is still a lot of redundant information. 
                </p>
    
            </div>    
          
            <p>
                Looking back, I do understand where I was coming from with the information overload. I wanted my homepage to introduce my users 
                to me and the latest projects I have worked on, while showcasing all the areas I dabble in.
            </p>

            <p>
                Mind you, by this point I hadn’t started wireframing for the other pages, mostly because I did not know where I wanted to go with 
                the layout of my website, as a whole. I can see that I was probably overthinking a lot of things, and too worried about aesthetics 
                rather than doing basic layouts that would communicate to me and the user. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Great start, but horrible implementation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3> Second Round of Wireframes</h3>

            <p>
                After receiving feedback, I decided to cut down on the colours, and hoped it would make things a bit clearer for me. Truthfully 
                the feedback surprised me, especially since I was told that I was too focused on the aesthetics and colour scheme, when I haven’t 
                even done the basic design. It was eye opening, because it was true. I was already thinking about the kind of animations I wanted, 
                meanwhile I had no website that could hold those animations. This is why I cut down on colours and focused on blocking out what 
                I wanted in the website. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For this second round, I also expanded to the blog homepage, just to see if I liked the layout.
            </p>
            
            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week4-images/week4-2ndWireframe-index-with-annotation.png" alt="Star's second wireframe design with
                    annotation for the index homepage" width="250" height="350">
                     <figcaption> Second wireframe design for homepage with annotations </figcaption>
                </figure>
                    
                <p>
                    This version is a bit clearn, but I added interaction notes all over the place. Here, I am thinking more about UI, since I have 
                    indicated that the homepage will have a vertical scrollbar for users to scroll up and down on the page. Here I have moved the 
                    redundant information, (the short headline and the short into) but kept the picture of me , and went with one of the designs 
                    from my first round of wireframes. There is a carousel near the end of the page which will display my featured/lastest works. 
                    There are buttons just under the carousel that will change what is displayed in the square when clicked.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Again, a good idea, but a strange way to implement it. Looking back I can see how messy my wirefram is due to the interaction 
                notes annotated all over it, its actually hard to make out what is going on. Another thing Im noticing is that, while I seemed 
                to use space a bit better than the first round of wireframes, that I still do not make use of the whitespace. Things just feel 
                like they are float randomly, and aren’t boxed in properly, or spaced out well. The scroll bar also is too long, and meshes with 
                the footer… there was a lot going on.
             </p>

            <p>
                Here is a version without the interaction notes:
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week4-images/week4-2ndWireframe-index-no-annotation.png" alt="Star's second wireframe design 
                    without annotation for the index homepage" width="250" height="350">
                    <figcaption> Second wireframe design for homepage without annotations </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Even without the interaction notes, there’s still something that is a bit…strange, and I think it’s mostly due to how I have 
                    used space. Here I was considering the UX, in that I didn’t want to overwhelm them with information. I wanted the site to look 
                    simple, and feel simple to explore. When the user lands on the homepage, then they see the site name and logo, followed by the 
                    navigation bar. Afterwards they see a drawn representation of me (or picture of me…still deciding), a small, quirky text followed 
                    by a call to action, something like “explore Star’s galaxy!”. Then if they did not know where to start, they’d simply scroll down 
                    and see my lastest works. 
                </p>

            </div>
          
            <p>
                I have so many buttons because I wanted to show my latest works for each section of my portfolio, e.g: Animation, game 
                development…etc. BUT looking at the wirefram now, these words would not fit into these tiny squares. Only the word blogs would.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also I’d like to note that the catergories for the Featured/Latest works section reduced from 5 in the first round of wireframes 
                (catergories were: blogs, development, 3d modelling, commisions and projects and animations.) Again, too much information, and 
                unnecessary buttons. 
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">

                </figure>

                <p>
                    If we have a look at the wireframe for the blogposts, you can see that I have sectioned them, a section for academic blog 
                    posts and a section for personal blog posts. 
                    Here, I can see that I intended to use the white space to focus the user’s attention to the centre of the page, since the content 
                    is centre aligned. It’s a bit wonky, but good nonetheless. The scrollbar is also much shorter than that of the first wireframe, 
                    and it irks me? I want my website to maintain consistenceny especially when it comes to the default user interface, such as 
                    scrollbars. 
                </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Overall I have nothing against this design, it is a design that I maintained in my newer wireframes for my blog posts, due to its 
                simplicity. It also inspired me to structure the layout of my newer wireframes in a simplistic way
            </p>
        </section>

      <section>
            <h3> Third Round of Wireframes </h3>
            <p>
                I would say my third round of wireframes are cleaner and easier to read. I structured them, using the HTML semantic markup of 
                each page as a guideline.
            </p>
            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week4-images/Third-Wire-IndexHomepage.png" alt="Third wireframe design for index homepage
                    with annotations" width="400" height="270">   
                    <figcaption> Third wireframe design for the index homepage </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    First we have the homepage! I am so proud of this new design. (not that new, still pretty similar to the previous one) but here, 
                    I make use of squares to block out the space. It is much neater, and does not look overwhelming at all. Especially since the 
                    interaction notes are on the side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Here, I’ve completely removed the unnecessary buttons for the carousel and left the three major works that I want to showcase on 
                the homepage, which would be: game development, animations and my blog posts. I am still considering the necessaity for these 
                buttons that change what the carousel displays. I do think it’s unnecessary at this point (mainly because it is a carousel so it 
                will automatically change), but I will see, because it seems like a cool feature to have. Other than that, nothing much changed! 
                The annotations got a bit more detailed and now include some html elements, just to make it clearer for me latr once I start 
                putting things together.

            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week4-images/Third-Wire-BlogHomepage.png" alt="Third wireframe desgin for blog homepage
                    with annotations" width="400" height="270">
                    <figcaption> Third wireframe design for the blog homepage </figcaption>
                </figure>
    
                <p>
                    The blog homepage has also stayed the same. The only difference is now I blocked out a space for the page title, because on my HTML
                    website, the blog page does have a title: “Da Blogz”.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The layout is also much cleaner, especially the spaces that I blocked out for the links to each blog post. The functionality of the 
                sidebar is for efficient navigation, since I may get to a stage where I have a lot of blog posts. I have considered having two 
                separate pages, one with the links to academic blog posts, and the other with links to personal blog posts, but I decided against it, 
                because it felt like the user would endlessly end up clicking just to navigate the blog post they’d like to read. Something I am 
                currently considering is, adding a search bar to this page, in hopes that it would make it easier for the user to locate the blog 
                they are looking for. I have also wondered if it would be better to order the blog posts from older to most recent or vice versa.

                <p>
                    I used the simplistic blog homepage design as inspiration for the layout of the profile homepage. 
                    This page does not need too many elements, basic user interface (scroll bar, fixed nav bar), a picture of me again and a space 
                    where I give more information about myself. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                After going through this process of wireframing multiple times, I feel like I now understand IxD, how to design with the user 
                in mind and how to wireframe properly. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially I honestly struggled with the idea of making a site that kept the users in mind, but I would say I am on the right 
                track now. And as I stated before, it’s much easier to wireframe for each page, since I already have them all laid out with 
                semantic markup in VScode. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Im proud of my progress thus far, and hope to showcase more than plain wireframes? Perhaps I’ll do another iteration of 
                wireframes where I start playing with the colour schemes.
