                In this blog post, Star goes a bit further in documenting her research for the design section 
                of her website. Please note that further thoughts and reflections, with visual imagery can be 
                found within the <a class="u-url" href="../../design/design-pages/design-style-guide.html"> 
                style guides</a> section of the website.

            <h3> Documentation of my Interaction Design Process: </h3>

            <p>
                When users click on my site, they will land on the homepage. The homepage will introduce them to me, my brand and 
                showcase my latest works. They can use the navigation bar to access the different sections of my website. 
                They will use buttons and links to explore more details about my work and move around the website. If they are 
                interested in commissioning me, they will read the pricing and rules, then navigate to the contact section to reach 
                out to me. (still wondering if I should have a whole page just for my contacts or if I should include them in the 
                footerâ€¦). The scrolling interactions allow them to browse through my projects, blog posts or design process.
            </p>

            <p>
                I made the interactions simple and intuitive. The navigation bar at the top of every page is so users always have easy 
                access to all sections of the website without backtracking. This is the same for the navigation buttons at the bottom of 
                each project/blog post/ design post. I opted for a minimalist-looking layout that would avoid clutter so that the users donâ€™t 
                feel overwhelmed while browsing through my site. My current homepage wireframe naturally guides users to either my profile 
                or my portfolio. And my portfolio page guides users to my commissions page before it goes into the different projects I have.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my first implementation, I made several changes to my wireframes as I started to consider useability and spacing. 
                I go more in-depth about the choices I made in <a class="u-url" href="week-4-blog-post.html">week 4â€™s blog post</a> and the 
                wireframing process in my style guide. I am happy with the current design, mostly because of how I have used space. 
                It does not feel too cluttered, even though most of the pages have quite a bit on them. I havenâ€™t made wireframes or 
                considered layouts for different screen sizes yet.

            <h3> Goal Alignment </h3>
            <p>
                The main goal of my website is to showcase my work to potential employers and clients in a way that is visually appealing, 
                organised and easy to navigate. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In my design, I have achieved this through: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Clean navigation that ensures users can quickly and easily access different sections of my website without confusion.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I have structured each section and each page (within my wireframe designs and hopefully html structure) in a way that 
                    naturally guides users to through my website, as explained above. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    My work is organised and easy to access. The buttons and links are strategically placed to help users navigate and to 
                    direct users to relevant sections without having to search in a crazy way.
                </li>

                <li>
                    And again, the minimalist layout that keeps attention on the content, without too many distractions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This aligns with my brand identity as I want to have a night sky aesthetic that makes browsing feel immersive, as if the 
                users are looking up at the stars and discovering my work. My primary colour palette reinforces the celestial, night sky 
                feel that also looks professional.
            </p>

            <h3> Information Structure</h3>
            <p>
                Let me start with my website structure:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HOMEPAGE:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Has a cute welcome message
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A brief intro to me and what my website is about
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Has a navigation bar that links to all sections
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Has quick links to my github and live website. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            So far these are the first few things that users see when they land on my website
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>PORTFOLIO:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Has a collection of my work (art, animation, game development projects, etc etc..)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Currently it is empty, but according to the wireframe design, it will have a preview of each piece, and â€˜view moreâ€™ 
                            button for each section that then redirects the user to a page of the relevant portfolio section.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the content is too much I will have to consider adding possible filters to help with sorting different types 
                            of work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users access the portfolio page through the nav bar, and a button on the homepage.. 
                        </li>

                I wanted my website to feel like a celestial experience, as if the users are browsing through the night sky. 
                This is because my website is called Starfish Galaxy, so I focused on colours that reflect that kind of cosmic-like and 
                dreamy aesthetic, while keeping everything clean and readable.
            </p>

            <p>
                I go more in-depth about this in the Style Guides under the Design section. Here are the colours I chose:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Midnight Violet (#160649). This is the background colour; it represents the deep space â€¦yeah.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Royal Blue (#296ac8). This is used for the interactive elements. It provides a vibrant contrast and a sense of 
                    professionalism.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lavender Blush (#cba1eb). Soft contrast to the royal blue, will be used for navigation bar, scrollbar background 
                    and the text in the footer, to keep things balanced and harmonious.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Soft Aqua (#92d2f5). Used for general text, adding a gentle, celestial glow while ensuring readability.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>
                Before settling on this colour palette, I played around with pinks, deeper purples, and sea-themed colours. They clashed 
                and readability looked terrible. So, I settled on a cooler, more harmonious balance of purples, blues and soft pastels.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                My first wireframe sketches focused more on colour than ensuring the layout isnâ€™t overwhelming for users, and accessibility. 
                They were blocky, too colour and basic with no annotation. I have refined them by adjusting the spacing, improving the 
                hierarchy and ensuring visual balance. Overall, the refinements helped create a website that is both visually engaging and 
                easy to use.
            </p>

                I have yet to finalise my font choices, but I do want to use fonts that evoke an ethereal yet simplistic feel. The typography 
                should complement my night-sky aesthetic while maintaining readability and a minimalistic, clean design. The reason for having 
                a clean design is because when we look up at the sky, there is cleanliness in the way the stars and things in space shine 
                above our heads. It never feels negatively overwhelming. The sky always feels beautiful, structured and awe inspiring. 
                To mirror this feeling, I am considering fonts like Raleway, Quicksand or Playfair Display as potential options.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This wraps up my style guide design process so far. I have made some solid progress on aligning my vision with the user 
                experience I want to create. Thereâ€™s still A LOT of work ahead of me, but I am excited to see how this will come together 
                in the final submission.
