                In this blog post, I look at two articles that speak about digital inclusion and design justice
                I share some examples and experiences, about factors that may make digital inclusion difficult.   
            </p>

        <section> 
            <p>
                In Silvia Magoni‚Äôs interview with Nanjira Sambuli ‚ÄòWhat is digital equality?‚Äô (2019), Sambuli defines digital Equality as 
                dissecting the analog and digital aspects of our current societal context and ensuring that we do not widen inequalities 
                through our use of digital technologies. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The main focus of the interview relates to people‚Äôs access to internet connectivity and digital technologies. Sambuli mentions 
                the inequalities that exist ‚Äúbetween and within geographies‚Ä¶gendered inequalities‚Äù. This couldn‚Äôt be more than true, 
                especially as a citizen living within South Africa that is third world country. There is a limited access to proper internet 
                connectivity and the digital technologies that help carry internet. Many areas within our country already lack an access to 
                basic services such as water and electricity. How then do we expect people to have internet access if they don‚Äôt even have 
                access to water? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Covid-19 highlighted the unequal access to internet services within our country. News and radio stations kept reporting how 
                people within rural areas and elderly people were unable to properly register to receive covid vaccines. This highlights that 
                inequality also exists amongst age groups. Everything moved online‚Äîor tried to during that period. Many school-going pupils 
                ranging from primary to university students had no access to the internet, or to devices that would facilitate their learning 
                experience. Many probably did not even have the proper space to continue their studies. On the flip side, many institiutions 
                and businesses did not have the means to either facilitate online tasks for workers and students, or help their workers and 
                students. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In my case, my school had no plan in place, nor did they have the financial means to try and move online. We attempted to by 
                moving to WhatsApp, but it fell through because whatsapp at the time was not an app that allowed for different types of 
                communication, as it is now with the streaming service available. Back then it was just a chatting app. And I am from a rural 
                area. Internet connectivity was a luxury (at the time there were very few cellphone towers), most people in my class and I did 
                not have laptops, and electricity in most areas was a joke. In an article by Mercedes Garcia-Escribano, ‚ÄòLow internet access 
                is driving inequality‚Äô (2020), they supply an image that states ‚Äúless than half the population in developing countries has 
                internet access. (which I have supplied for your convenience üòâ)
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week9-images/internet-inequality-stats.png" 
                    alt="2018 statistic image showing the internet avaliability of people across the globe" 
                    width="230" height="390" >
                    <figcaption>2018 statistic image showing the internet avaliability of people across the globe</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                   Garcia-Escribano‚Äôs article also states that countries in sub-saharan Africa and those in developing countries in Asia 
                   have the lowest access to the internet. Looking at the example I gave about my personal experience with covid-19 and 
                   moving online, I truthfully say that the lack of proper internet access and the means to facilitate an online classroom, 
                   absolutely ruined my school‚Äôs productivity. We did not learn anything from the 27th of March till the 18th (I think, I 
                   cannot remember what day I returned to high school), meaning that our teachers had to quickly force all the knowledge 
                   into our brains just so we could pass that year.  
                </p>
                
            </div>

            <p>
                Just as Sambuli mentions, to achieve digital equality, we also need to dig into history, understand our present so that we 
                can apply a systems thinking approach to solving these problems that would better our futures. Inequalities, outside of 
                digital and internet access already exist. Now, in a world where everything is online: opportunities are posted online, 
                people build their brands online, news is online, shopping can be done online, books! Books can be read online! It is 
                important to ensure that we do not widen the ever-growing inequality gap, and design technologies that are accessible and 
                ethical (in terms of safety and digital data safety). A way we could do this, is by approaching these problems ourselves. 
                I can ask myself: ‚ÄúWith all the dreams I have, how can I ensure that my community is not left behind, that newer generations 
                don‚Äôt have to experience what I had to, or worse. How can I design digital technologies that aim to bridge the gap while 
                maintaining an African cultural heritage that isn‚Äôt erased by adopting linear thinking, western methods? 
            </p>

            <p>
                In Cheptoo Kositany-Buckner‚Äôs Article ‚Äòdigital inclusion‚Äô they argue that internet access is no longer a luxury but has 
                become a lifeline for many. With everything moving online, it feels as if it is only a matter of time before things remain 
                strictly online, and this is a systematic injustice to the many on this world who do not even have internet access. The article 
                makes it a civil rights issue, and I can‚Äôt help but agree as someone who was in that position. I didn‚Äôt have the means to, 
                so I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äòlog in‚Äô or further my skills, so I and many in my situation couldn‚Äôt even show up for ourselves simply because 
                our circumstances and the technologies created to ‚Äòmake life easier‚Äô didn‚Äôt actually. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Thinking about it from a Web-Dev POV made me realise that if I want to incorporate design justice into the things I create, 
                I will have to consider things like offline compatibility, lightweight design (not data heavy) and responsiveness on multiple 
                devices, even those 1,2,3 phones (sorry I forgot the name) since so many people in our country still use them, as their only 
                phone. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Another Point Sambuli makes is the fact that designers and developers treat access as the finish line, which then reinforces 
                existing inequalities rather than solving them. Have these designers thought about‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶everything else?? Can people afford 
                the data needed to access the space? Do they even know how to navigate the space?? Are designers creating a meaningful 
                participatory experience for users‚Ä¶or are we just making stuff and conforming to a western designed system?
            </p>

            <p>
                This also made me wonder about the people I may be un-intentionally excluding due to my stereotypical idea of what a ‚Äòdefault 
                user‚Äô looks like. I never, once stopped to consider that my website should also be accessible to people who aren‚Äôt only 
                English-speak, urban-living, high-literacy and high-speed connected people. As my website stands today (the 20th of April 
                2025), I have literally excluded most of the global south from accessing my website. Very sad to think about, as someone who 
                lives in the global South. This is something I will work on correcting as I develop my skillset.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nonetheless, digital equality is about dismantling the systematic barriers that shapes who gets to be online and how. Let‚Äôs 
                try to aim for equal experiences and apply system thinking approach to the solutions we aim to develop for our country and 
                our world.
            </p>
