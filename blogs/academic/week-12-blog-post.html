                This blog post is about more than code! Star opens up about going against the easy route of copying tutorials and 
                instead tries to learn JavaScript with intention and awareness. She tries to connected her learning process to 
                decolonial theory, challenging the dominance of Western tech norms in both language and design.

        <section> 
            <p>
               I am writing this blog post from a very humbled and honest standpoint. üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
            </p>

            <p>
                I have not yet implemented JavaScript into my website yet (save for the JS coding exercises). This is not because of 
                laziness, it is mainly due to my intention and approach to this very weird language. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I am actively learning plain JavaScript and resisting the urge to just find tutorials that show how to implement the 
                things I want in my website and just copy-paste the code from the tutorials, without an understanding of what I am 
                doing. That was how I began my journey with coding in Unity C# and even now, I do realise that I am very dependent 
                on tutorials to help me start projects, without an idea of how to go about the things I want to implement.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is not a mistake I want to repeat with JS. No hate to tutorials! But the difference between the tutorials that 
                show you how to build a certain thing and tutorials that kind of explains certain things within the JS language, 
                such as how Arrays work, is understanding. I want that foundational understanding of the language, and that is what 
                I am actively building. I want to gain this knowledge and use it to create digital spaces that are thoughtful, 
                intentional and well‚Ä¶African. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I may be wrong, but this approach does feel like a decolonial practise. My process to this is intentional, and in 
                that I will start to ask questions like: ‚ÄúOh okay‚Ä¶ why do we use certain patterns and code in these ways? Who benefits 
                from these features? Who do I unintentionally leave out?‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
                I have taken time to explore my website with a fresh lens and started identifying where and how I want to implement 
                JavaScript to support my design without bloating the website or making it too ‚Äòheavy‚Äô. With the help of feed back from 
                my tutors, here is what I have noted so far:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A carousel on the homepage to display my latest works and make the landing experience lively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bottom navigation buttons/links on the blog-like pages for a smoother experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Navigation buttons within the nav bar, for the same reason.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A filter system on the portfolio so that users can explore projects by category.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removing the hover from images + portfolio items and implement a lightbox-like thing that allows users to click and 
                    open the items to see them clearly (especially since users cannot hover on mobile). I think this will improve 
                    accessibility and make the mobile UI clearer
                </li>
                <li>
                    A few decorative animations üòè 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                That is what I have thought about so far. I keep wondering though, how can my website‚Ä¶as a digital space, feel LESS 
                like a Western wireframe clone and more like something that speaks to my world? Being South African, attending a uni 
                in Johannesburg, a reflection of my creative thoughts and lived experiences‚Ä¶
            </p>

            <p>
                I guess for now the biggest change I have made (and will continue to make) is internal. I am shifting my mindset and 
                my approach from just ‚Äòdoing what works‚Äô to ‚Äòunderstanding why it works‚Äô. I really want to become a developer who 
                codes with clarity, INTENTION and integrate cultural context‚Ä¶somehow. I am sure it‚Äôs possible. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Decolonising my coding process means resisting the urge to ‚Äòjust get it done‚Äô and instead trying to embrace the 
                process of learning with purpose. I know that code isn‚Äôt neutral, and I hope this approach I am taking will 
                continually remind me of that fact.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yeah so‚Ä¶to sum it up üòÖ, I haven‚Äôt started implementing these features with JavaScript just yet. But I have mapped 
                out where and why I want to do so.
            </p>

            <h3>Edit Addition: </h3>
            <p>
                In truth, it would be difficult to start decolonising my code, since the languages that I am using are done in 
                English and follow a Western Standard. Even the language I am using on my website is in English and unintentionally 
                excludes users who may not know English that well or at all. It is very ironic of me to say I am taking the steps to 
                decolonise my coding process, but still follow the Western standards set before me when it comes to coding. We may be 
                living in a (perceived) post-colonial world, but many of the world systems and technologies in place stem from the 
                colonial era. Dr Mustafa Ali touches on this in his article ‚ÄòDecolonising computing‚Äô, when he states ‚Äúwhat decolonial 
                theorists refer to as ‚Äòcoloniality‚Äô ‚Äì then it might be that computing continues to bear the ‚Äòlegacy systemic‚Äô 
                traces of colonialism; in short, computing is a modern/colonial phenomenon,‚Äù (Dr Ali 2021). This is true regarding 
                the points I mentioned, the approach we are taking to learning coding languages is already quite colonial due to 
                something as simple as the medium of instruction and understanding being English. The way in which we read and write, 
                from left to right, is a Western structure that we have adopted as our own. 
            </p>

            <p>
                South Africa has 11 official languages, yet very few South African owned businesses have ensured that their websites 
                translates to all of them or at least the top 4 languages in the country to ensure accessibility. To truly decolonise 
                my code, I would have to think about the community I left back at home, a community that speaks vernacular languages. 
                How does looking at my website which is fully in English benefit or help them, are they able to understand? If I 
                showed them my code, would they be able to make sense of what I am trying to do even without understanding the 
                concepts? Would I then be able to teach these concepts to them? I need to find a way to bridge that gap. If we look 
                at the ‚ÄòCode kumnandi‚Äô initiative by the CodeMakers, then doing something like this would be the best starting ground. 
                Code kumnandi launched isiZulu as one of the 48 langauages available on the Scratch platform. Scratch is a visual 
                programming language, meant to introduce beginners and children into the world of coding (Internet Matters, 2025). 
            </p>

            <p>
                Localising coding languages into South African home languages would already bridge one part of the gap for many people. 
                Then as developers we would need to consider how we would then either shake the Western structure and ensure that our 
                projects are still taken seriously on the world stage, or bridge the other gap in transferring the knowledge and 
                skills that people built up, so that they‚Äôll have the ability to code in their mother tongue and the language of the 
                world, English. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This takes me back to the initial question though‚Ä¶ I have identified things within my own coding practise to be aware 
                of. But how can I go about bringing change?
            </p>

            <p>
                It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôll continually think about.
