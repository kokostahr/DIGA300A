            <h3>Short Review on BLING GIRL.CO.ZA </h3>

            <p>
                Bling Girl is a south African beauty product…brand. Their products are of a high quality and really good. As an 
                aspiring nail tech, I really recommend their products.
                But we’re here to look at their website. And their website… well… it’s a bit chaotic.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Just from the homepage, we can see that there is a lot going on. And my images do not show it, but these 
                images that say “save 50%” flash and show all the different colours of the products available. This 
                display is overwhelming and not necessarily intuitive for a user who lands on the site for the first 
                time. I know I was very confused when using the website. LOOK at the comparison to another beauty brand, 
                called Born Pretty. Look at how sleek and tidy their homepage is. There is a banner (which looks AI 
                generated but anyways) and the navigation makes sense. As a user I know that the products displayed on 
                the homepage are ‘trending’ products. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Anywhomst, let us take a look at Bling Girl’s products, and how they display the products.
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week7-images/screenshotBlingGirlWebsite-3.png" 
                    alt="First Screenshot of Bling Girl's Product Navigation Page" width="390" height="230" >
                    <figcaption>First Screenshot of Bling Girl's Product Navigation Page</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    When you click on the “All Products” link in the navigation bar, it brings you to a page where all 
                    the products are displayed and sorted into different categories. Many of the categories seem 
                    unnecessary. When you click on one category it expands and shows multiple options underneath 
                    that category. Such as the “BEGINNER SETS” that also shows a “KID SET” option. If you go 
                    through the website you’ll see that many of the extra categories have no products to display, 
                    and in my opinion it makes the navigation experience frustrating. Also as a person that knows 
                    what I am looking for (such as shopping for certain items) I must say that the way in which they 
                    have placed certain items makes no sense and seems redundant. 
                </p>         
            </div>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week7-images/screenshotBlingGirlWebsite-4.png" 
                    alt="Second Screenshot of Bling Girl's Product Navigation Pag" width="390" height="230" >
                    <figcaption>Second Screenshot of Bling Girl's Product Navigation Page</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Under nails there is a sub-category called UV GELS that has 21 items on display. And the items displayed 
                    within this category could’ve been categorised into the other categories at the top, underneath 
                    “Gels&Acyrlic Powders”.
                </p>         
            </div>

                <p>
                    SEE?? It’s so messy and redundant. It feels like this website was not designed by people who know how to 
                    categorise nail products or… just any products.

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <p>
                The only pro of this website is that… it functions as a medium that allows users to purchase the relevant items 
                they need.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3> Cons</h3>
            <p>
                The site is too cluttered, there is no aesthetic, there are too many visuals that aren’t placed in a way that 
                does not overload the user (visual pollution), there is a LACK of consistency between the different webpages 
                from the nav bar. AND to top it all off, the navigation SUCKS!
