   <h2>Week Wan: Imagining the Internet + Getting set up</h2> 

<h3> 
    Experience setting up GitHub and Publishing to Pages?
</h3>
<p>
    I found the first phase very confusing, mostly because of VSCode. 
    I was unable to tell when a folder was open. 
    I kept clicking “open folder” not realising that the folder was open on 
    the left-hand side of the VSCode interface (as depicted in the screenshot below)

<p>
   
    Afterwards, I had trouble finding out how to “create new: index.html.” 
    I wasn’t sure if I had to find a “create new” button, or simply add it… 
    I couldn’t figure it out, so I ended up googling how to do it. 
    Sad to say that not even the google results I got were very helpful.

    
</p>

<p>
    In the end I discovered that I can create a new index by double-clicking in the gap underneath the file name. 
    I felt very stupid for a good twenty minutes., and a bit overwhelmed when I had to allow VSCode to link to my GitHub account. 
    I had run into another funny problem, just opening the repo because it kept sending me back to VSCode, showing that my repo has been published, 
    but not showing me the repo online. To solve this problem, 
    I went to my GitHub account online and opened the repo manually rather than being redirected.
</p>

<p>
    From there on out, I had no problem seamlessly following the guide and setting up the website.

    Reflections on the readings you have chosen:
</h3>

<p>
    Flash formed the first foundation of web design, video players online and games. 
    I remember playing plenty of dress up games in the 2000s that would ask me to install the flash player before playing the game.
</p>

<p> 
    It’s quite sad to see how something that started a new era of technology, is slowly fizzling out. 
    But that is the way the internet works, right? 
    Technology moves fast, and companies quickly hop onto the latest trends as the applications and technologies that started the transition and laid the foundation, slowly disappear. 
    A good example of this would be Blackberry Messenger (BBM), iPhone messenger and Whatsapp. Blackberry was the phone to have during the 2000s 
    (just like iPhone was in the 2010s and 2020s). 
    I remember it being the leader of mobile messaging app and growing up during a period where I had an android and those old ABD, 123 phones. 
    Everyone and their mothers had a blackberry and couldn’t stop talking about BBM! 
    I felt very left out as an android user as even when I downloaded BBM on my phone, it did not work well.
</p>

<p>
    Just like the article on flash described, BBM had the same kind of fall off. Phones and technologies started to evolve and BBM was not moving fast enough to keep up with all the changes. 
    Whatsapp saw an opportunity to provide similar services and ensured that their application was compatible on most devices at the time. 
    Mobile messaging was no longer a niche thing that only Blackberry users had, so there was no incentive really for people to keep buying Blackberry devices. According to Wikipedia, BBM shut down in 2019 
    (I’m surprised that it lasted that long.) 
    Ios messenger kind of copied the niche thing that Blackberry had going, by creating a messaging platform for users who only had iOS devices. 
    I suppose that is why, even to this day, Whatsapp remains the number one mobile messenger platform in the world. 
    Because it is available for all users, on all types of devices (even PC and laptops now).

   
</p>

<p>
    I think the main point about Flash and BBM, is that if companies try to make something niche, 
    but can’t adapt to the changing technologies without making it accessible to most devices, 
    then it does not stand a chance in our ever-changing world.
    Sad to think that two decades from now, people won’t even know what Flash or BBM were, 
    or the impact they had in laying the foundations for most of the software, applications and technologies we use today.
</p>

<p>
    Web 1.0 (according to the Wiki site) seemed to be a static kind of internet, back in the days, 
    where people could mainly interact with content by reading it and flipping through pages/websites. 
    It seems like people couldn’t necessarily interact with the content and could only read it. 
    I think this is where Flash came in, as the leader for website design, animations and buttons, 
    as they made sites more interactive for users.
</p>

<p>
    Looking at the timeline of when internet transitioned from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, BBM also came up. 
    I believe it could have been one of the major, first examples of how engaging the internet could be. 
    Users were messaging one another directly, sharing content and updates. 
    It tied into the trend of instant messaging and access. 
    BBM’s downfall gave rise to new mobile applications. 
    Applications made it easier for people to share content, stream content, and start shaping their own algorithms. 
    Dare I say, certain social media sites made it easier for people to get notice and rise up; which (in my humble GenZ opinion) made having a personal website that showcased your skills, IRRELEVANT. 
    People use their social profiles as their portfolio’s these days. 
    On top of that, social media made it easier for people to interact and engage with one another by liking, sharing and commenting. 
    It also made it easier to advertise ourselves, and meet people in different parts of the world 
</p>

<p>
    So, Web 2.0 to me is the shift towards engaged content, on interactive platforms. 
    Web 1.0 made use of Hypertext Links and Hypermedia, that allowed webpages to be connected to each other. 
    In Harper’s ‘As we may think’ at 65’, he describes how Bush emphasised the importance of machinery tailoring its information to 
    ‘enhance human cognition’ especially if the information is complex and gets us thinking, as humans (Harper 2010, p 2-3). 
    It is sad to see that, even with the ability to shape our own algorithms (to some extent) on social sites, 
    and with the mass amounts of information available to us, there seems to be a mental decline in human cognition. 
    This is seen through short attention spans, a growing obsession with the self and the lack of common sense (especially when it comes to fact checking the things we interact with.) 
    Many people blindly believe what they engage with, and it’s a sad sight. 
    I believe the colloquial term for our mental decline as a society is called brain rot. 
    In my retrospective view, I do not think that this is the result Bush had envisioned for our society.
</p>

<p>
    What is brain rot: ‘Brain rot’ is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, 
    especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material 
    (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. 
    Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration”.

    (NB: trivial or unchallenging ಠ_ಠ. Let's stop watching nonsense, guys).

<h3>
    My goals for this course:
</h3>

<p>
    To craft multiple platforms, explore the development of the internet (especially with the push of Ai), 
    to stack up my development skills and make cool, interactive websites. 
    (Like Samsung’s or Xiaomi’s websites! Have you seen them?!)
    -END-
