                In this post Star calls out the current internet 'structure' and its shady antics surrounding privacy, while 
                dreaming up a digital world where users have rights, consent is real, and the trolls are silenced, not the victims.
            </p>

            <p>
                What does an ethical internet look like to me? To me, an ethical internet is one where human dignity and our 
                consent, are the foundation for the way we interact in this digital space. I think we desperately need a cyberspace 
                that respects boundaries and empowers ALL users instead of exploiting them. The very core of this would be data… 
                how its collected, used, sold and distributed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Honestly, the current state of the internet appears to be…chaotic 😬. I would liken it to people in some countries (
                    not pointing fingers but the USA 😑) who think its OKAY to just record random strangers they don’t know, without 
                    consent and putting the videos online for profit. Very suspicious behaviour. According to Ned Thornton (2024) in 
                    his article, one of the ways to promote ethical data usages, through building a taxonomy for data privacy, would 
                    require obtaining informed consent before collecting personal information, and allowing users to choose which data 
                    they do not want collected. This would look like, websites removing their default opt-ins and sneaky cookie banners. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A truly ethical internet would put transparency and agency at the centre. According to Alex Carmona, in her article 
                ‘The Guide to an Ethical Web: With Big Data Comes Big Responsibility’, companies need to be accountable not only for 
                the data they collect, but also how they interpret it and use it. Biased algorithms and data misuse can reinforce 
                discrimination and social inequality. If AI systems are trained on these biased datasets, they may end up reinforcing 
                existing social inequalitites, such as denying people jobs or healthcare access. A good example of this is in American 
                law enforcement (always a problem) where facial recognition technologies have led to…terrible incidents. As reported 
                Alyxaundria Sandfod (2024) in their article, six out of the seven people were wrongfully accused by AI facial 
                recognition technologies, were black. This highlights how biased data can lead to dangerous consequences, especially 
                for marginalised communities. It also shows that without proper ethical use and oversight, the internet and its 
                technologies will continue to reflect and reinforce harmful social biases.  
            </p>

            <p>
                In regards to surveillance and privacy, Biswajit Sahu’s article (2023) points out how modern online systems turn 
                people’s interactions and behaviour into a product that can be sold. Everything we do online is tracked, collected 
                and sold, usually without us even knowing. To make the internet more ethical, users should be treated as people with 
                rights, not just as sources of data 🙄. This means that privacy SHOULD be built into digital platforms from the 
                BEGINNING, (Once I know how to do this, I’ll also try my best to incorporate in my development routine) and not only 
                added later after a serious scandal has taken place. 
            </p>

            <p>
                An ethical internet would also support inclusivity and equal access. (Which is a whole other issue in itself, because 
                for access to truly be equal, we would have to solve the issue of service distribution in lower income communities, 
                then afford people the technologies to access the internet, but for not let’s just pretend). The internet should be a 
                space where different voice are not only heard, but also protected. Hate speech and harassment are rampant because 
                platforms usually prioritise engagement over ethical use. Platforms must find ways to implement stronger moderation 
                that does not silence marginalised voice, but shields them from abuse. (If games can do it…somewhat, why can’t social 
                platforms do it???). The goal should be to create an internet where everyone feels safe enough to speak without 
                harming others!
            </p>

            <p>
                Anywhomst, an ethical internet, to me, should be built on trust, transparency and mutual respect between 
                organisations, creators and users. Users should know exactly what is happening with their information and have the 
                option to opt out without being penalised (Sorry, you cant access this website without: cookies, account creation, 
                location tracking, cellphone number requirement…really fill in the blank of your choice, there’s so many that its 
                annoying🫤 ). Users should be able to enjoy a digital space where ethics aren’t a ‘maybe if we want to…’ where they 
                ARE NOT optional, but embedded into the code.   
            </p>
