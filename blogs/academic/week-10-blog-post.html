                For this week‚Äôs blog entry, Star dives into a close reading of one of her assigned academic texts. With the Greenstein 
                et al. (2018) article as her guide, she explores how internet accessibility is affected by geography, and how our 
                locations influence and are influenced by the internet itself.
            </p>

        <section> 
            <p>
                It turns out, where you live, really DOES matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                In ‚Äòhow Geography Shape and is shaped by the internet,‚Äô Shane Greenstein, Chris Forman and Avi Goldfarb examine the 
                mess that is the internet‚Äôs impact on geography. This reveals a world where technology isn‚Äôt the equaliser we all 
                thought it would be. The internet has provided a lot of benefits, like mass communication, transportation and even 
                made some processes easier, such as researching for example (thank you Google scholar). Unfortunately, not everyone 
                is able to benefit from these benefits. Instead, geography still matters, since a lot of factors and resources 
                available heavily influence who thrives and who does not.
            </p>

            <p>
                The chapter begins by challenging the ‚Äòdeath of distance‚Äô narrative.  Although the internet has made life easier, 
                especially for communication, many people still prefer face-to-face communication when it comes to sharing complex 
                information and building trust. As much as the world loves to romanticise te idea of virtual workspaces, I‚Äôd like to 
                think that major deals and innovations often still rely on physical proximity. (An example? Ukraine‚Äôs president coming 
                to south Africa for the first time. Why didn‚Äôt they have this meeting ‚Äòonline‚Äô?)
            </p>

            <p>
                When it comes to adoption and use, the realities of geography become even clearer. Urban areas are equipped with so 
                much more: better broadband infrastructure and a huge network of skilled people, meaning that urban areas are more 
                likely to use leverage the internet‚Äôs potential. Meanwhile, rural areas continue to struggle. According to opensignal 
                (2023), rural South Africans experience significantly slower and less reliable mobile connections, than those in urban 
                areas. (This is one of the MAIN reasons I dread going back home.) It‚Äôs a stark reminder that even in 2025, the 
                digital divide still exists.
            </p>

            <p>
                This divide is not limited to infrastructure. Smaller businesses may struggle without access to immediate IT assistance 
                that larger firms, located in major economic centres can afford, which limits the smaller businesses‚Äô abilities to 
                compete online. Even people will adapt based on their income, education levels and where they are. Social spillovers 
                matter, since people are more likely to be online if their neighbours are as well. WHEREAS, in rural areas, if I do 
                not even have access to electricity, what will encourage my neighbour to spend the last of their money on data?
            </p>

            <p>
                The economic consequences of this uneven digital adoption are lopsided. In its initial stages, people may have hoped 
                that the internet would level the economic playing field, but most recent research shows a clear divergence. Major 
                cities that are rich in human capital and resources, continue to have the most economic gains. A 2022 study in 
                telecommunications policy revealed that remote work opportunities are highly concentrated in dense urban centres. 
                Smaller towns and rural areas are largely excluded from the increase in the remote work ‚Äòindustry‚Äô, missing ANOTHER 
                potential equalising force
            </p>

            <p>
               Even when rural areas invest in digital infrastructure, the promised payoffs are not guaranteed. A recent 2024 study on 
               e-commerce adoption (arXIV 2024) shows that while urban consumers have increasingly embraced online shopping, rural 
               communities remain underserved due to logistical challenges and a lower digital literacy. (SOME may not even own the 
               proper technology to access online shopping‚Ä¶). This is another barrier to rural economic inclusion. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Things get a bit more complicated when looking at innovaton. While the internet does enable more collaboration among 
                individuals, researchers and businesses, it can also lead to groups of people collaborating within their own tightly 
                knit digital circles, rather than expanding their networks across different countries and places. Sadly, ontop of 
                this. Talent from rural areas have always moved to metropolitan areas since they are hubs for innovation. As 
                Journalism.University (2024) reports, young professionals often move to urban centres where digital ecosystems and 
                career opportunities are Vast.
            </p>

            <p>
                The internet helps businesses expand internationally due to globalisation. But it has not entirely erased the 
                frictions of global commerce. A lot of factors such as the need for highly skilled workers, mean that physical 
                location still has an influence on a business‚Äô success in the international markets. A report by ITU on eTrade for 
                all (2024) highlights how despite the rising internet connectivity all over the world, low-income regions 
                (particularly in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America) remain severely underserved compared to wealthier 
                regions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The chapter then concludes with a grim thought. Despite the Internet‚Äôs transformative potential, it has not yet lived 
                up to the utopian dream of evenly spreading opportunities and success. Instead, it has just amplified existing 
                inequalities. A lot is still unknown about the Internet and why it‚Äôs full economic promises remains so unevenly 
                distributed, as well as how we can go about bridging this digital divide. Personally, I think it would take a lot 
                for it to ever be bridged. For those in power to consider ways to uplift their own people. But that‚Äôs a conversation 
                for another day.
