                Star uses this blog post to reflect on Sheena Magenya‚Äôs call for an internet shaped by African feminists, not 
                JUST western tech bros. She connects the reading to her own critical lens as a student-designer-artist, realising 
                how deep colonial influences go in digital tools we all use. The article and her reflection, highlight that building 
                better technologies means rethinking how it's built in the first place.

            <p>
                The article by Sheena Magenya argues that the internet should reflect African feminist voices and perspectives 
                instead of continuing to be shaped by dominant western narratives and technologies. (So basically what we have been 
                discussing for the past three weeks.) The article focuses on the need for digital spaces that centre African feminist 
                values, and our resistance to oppressive systems both online and offline.
            </p>

            <p>
                I found this article relevant, since it highlights the role that African women have online; we‚Äôre not just passive 
                users of the internet but also active shapers of it. Magenya challenges us to imagine a digital world that serves 
                everyone, not just those with access or pirivilege. While I had not really considered how deeply western biases and 
                ideologies are embedded in the technological and digital tools we use, this article made me more aware of how internet 
                design can reflect colonial structures. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In class, the past three weeks, we‚Äôve discussed the politics of design and the importance of digital inclusion, so this 
                article really connected well with these themes. It also made me think about how as a student and a future developer 
                in this space, I have a role in questioning whose voices I am amplifying online through the work I create and how 
                platforms could be more inclusive. Its funny because, living in JHB for the past 3 years at a uni residence, kind of 
                made me forget that I fall into the category of people who are digitally excluded (due to geography and a lack of 
                service delivery in my hometown.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Anywhomst, the article reminded me that a feminist internet isn‚Äôt just about representation, but also about rethinking 
                and reshaping the way we use the internet and design digital technologies, while remaining empathetic to our 
                livilihoods here in Africa. It left me reflecting on how I can engage more critically with digital tools and challenge 
                existing narrative in my own work. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Do I have time to do it right now as a student? Maybe, maybe not. We shall see.
            </p>
