                <p>
                    Interaction Design is important and is something I am thinking about while wireframing. 
                    I am adding a few interaction notes to my wireframes, but I keep changing the wireframe design (I am so undecisiveâ€¦).

                <h3> Relation to Knowledge about URL Scheme and Semantic Markup</h3>

                <p>
                    Well, the folder structure I have set up controls how all my files and 
                    images are organised, accessed by the web and loaded. If my stuff is a 
                    mess then it becomes harder and frustrating for users to navigate my 
                    website. 
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    As explained in class, Semantic Markup refers to the use of html tag, 
                    and using them in a meaningful way (and not just putting <code>&lt;<div></div></code> 
                    everywhere.) Structuring my folders, and laying out my interaction 
                    design is an important step as it helps me use html tags that will 
                    give meaning to my content. So before we had a class, this week where 
                    Semantic Markup was explained, I had random heading tags all over 
                    the place, and used it to define the navigation bar, not knowing that 
                    there were relevant HTML tags that could structure my UI and layout 
                    elements. Iâ€™ll admit that I am still confused about the <code>&lt;<section></section></code> tag, 
                    but I will research a bit more on it.

                <h3> Reflection on my development progres for the week </h3>

                <p>
                    This week, after learning about semantic markups, I have gone into 
                    my code and added navigation bars to the top of each page, as it is 
                    something I want to re-occur on each page. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also intend to go into my homepage and start defining the different 
                    sections that it will have. The only problem is, I am quite 
                    backtracked when it comes to my wireframe. I have changed it so much 
                    and am still unhappy with the current design I have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But I plan to continue refining it until I feel like the layout and 
                    the interaction design elements are user friendly. (One thing I 
                    cannot get over or seem to adjust my mindset to, is the fact that I 
                    am making a website for me, but also for the userâ€¦ so every step of 
                    the way, I have to think about the user and how theyâ€™ll be navigating 
                    my site.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    -THE END-
