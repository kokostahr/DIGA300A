                In this week's blog post, Star shares her thoughts on how justice and ethics show up in creative and technical work. 
                She acknowledges the limitations of her postion, and still chooses to act with intention and empathy.

            <p>
                When I think of justice and ethics in my own creative practises, I see it as more than a ‚Äòmoral checklist‚Äô. I know 
                that in this digital age, it‚Äôs a responsibility. I want to ensure that my practises reflect my genuine nature, 
                fairness and accountability.
            </p>

            <p>
                Justice, to me is about representation and access. Am I designing characters, games and websites that speak to a 
                variety of experiences, and not just mainstream, westernised ones? Am I coding interfaces that are accessible to 
                people with disabilities, or limited access? To me, Justice means building worlds where people feel seen and 
                empowered, regardless of the medium they interact with.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then, ethics‚Ä¶well, haha. Ethics in our modern world is like muddy water (don‚Äôt believe me? Look at AI, data 
                collection, and user manipulation). In programming especially, its easy to prioritise aesthetics, speed and success 
                over integrity. But ethical choices matter. As programmers we need to consider how we are storing user data, and 
                if we are being transparent with our audiences
            </p>

            <p>
                The ACM Code of Ethics helped me reflect. I‚Äôd say it lists rules that should be the moral compass for programmers and 
                developers, and the first rule they have‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúContribute to society and human well-being,‚Äù stood out to me because 
                developers should be considering the consequences of what they create, not just how well it performs. (May I also 
                say that its very ironic that the website relating to code ethics has a disruptive cookie banner? Hypocrisy at its 
                finest).
            </p>

            <p>
                I keep wondering though‚Ä¶
            </p>

            <p>
                How can I even fully commit to justice and ethics when I am still working within a system that wasn‚Äôt built for me? 
                Everything I am learning is through a Western lens. All my readings, lectures and even the coding language and 
                market I am being trained for aren‚Äôt rooted in my African identity or reality. I create in English. I present my work 
                for a Western gaze. I am constantly shaping stories to fit into boxes that do not reflect where I come from.
            </p>

            <p>
                To me‚Ä¶ this feels like a justice issue, too.
            </p>

            <p>
                Realistically, there isn‚Äôt a whole lot I could do alone that would shift an entire system or magically centre the 
                South African experience in the global tech and artistic spaces.
            </p>

            <p>
                But I am not here to just complain and sit quietly in discomfort. With the system I am under, there is still a lot I 
                can do. And a lot I will do. I can stay informed about ethical practices through resources like the Electronic 
                Frontier Foundation (EFF)‚Äôs articles on student privacy and online behavioural tracking (they have so many good 
                articles on their site, omg). I can be intentional with how I code and who I represent in my work. I can challenge 
                stereotypes in the characters I create for animations and games, and do my best to think critically about consent, 
                data and user rights going forward; yes even as a student.
            </p>

            <p>
                And yeah.
            </p>

            <p>
                -FIN-
