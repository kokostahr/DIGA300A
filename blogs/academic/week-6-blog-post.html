            <p>
                I wanted to see how the colours would look like on my actual website so after learning a few tricks, (very few, mind you) I applied the colours to the Index homepage, using my wireframe as a guideline. 
                So far, I am very happy with the colour scheme I have chosen, as all the colours work extremely well together. 

            </p>

            <p>
                Then I started playing around with the fonts to see which fonts felt simplistic yet personally resonated with me.
            </p>

            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week6-images/scaryScreenshotOfWebsite-1.png" alt="Star's website with CSS for the first time" width="390" height="230">
                    <figcaption> A screenshot of Star's website, where the fonts and colour scheme are terrible.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    As you can see from the image, the fonts were…all over the place. This was also the moment where I realised that there were changes that I would have to make to my html structure so that it 
                    can match the layout of my wireframe.  
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                In my wireframes, the name of my website is situated on the left-hand side of the navigation bar, so that is a change I will have to make to all the navigation bars across my webpage. 
                Secondly, I will have to change the ‘blog homepage’ link to ‘blogs’ because it is too long to fit within the boxes that I will make once I implement the flexbox style into my navigation bar. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="pictextContainer">
                <figure>
                    <img class="u-photo" src="../blog-images/week6-images/scaryScreenshotOfWebsite-2.png" alt="Star's website with CSS for the first time" width="390" height="230">
                    <figcaption> A screenshot of Star's website, where the fonts and colour scheme are terrible.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Despite this, I still tried to play around with the fonts, until I finally settled on fonts that worked well together, and with the theme of my website. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                I focused on further developing my style guide, updating it with decisions on fonts, colours, and the overall visual direction of my website. I wanted to ensure that every element contributes 
                to the celestial, dreamy atmosphere I’m aiming for. For a more detailed look at my thought process and final choices, check out the Style Guide in my Design section.

                Thank you.
